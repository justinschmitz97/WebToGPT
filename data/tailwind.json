Tailwind CSS v3.0 is a new major version of the framework and there are some minor breaking changes, but we’ve worked really hard to make the upgrade process as smooth as possible, and for most projects you should be able to install v3.0 without making any changes. For example, Tailwind UI is probably the biggest Tailwind project on earth and every template is totally compatible with both v2 and v3 with no changes required. For more details and step-by-step instructions on migrating to v3.0, check out the upgrade guide . Back in March we introduced the brand new Just-in-Time engine which brought huge performance gains, unlocked exciting new features like arbitrary values , and made complex variant configurations a thing of the past. In Tailwind CSS v3.0, the new engine has gone stable and replaced the classic engine, so every Tailwind project can benefit from these improvements out of the box. Before the new engine, we always had to be careful with CSS file size in development, and one of the biggest trade-offs we had to make was carefully limiting the color palette. In v3.0, every single color in the extended color palette is enabled by default, including lime, cyan, sky, fuchsia, rose, and fifty shades of gray. Check out the color palette reference to learn more. People have been asking us for colored shadows for years, but supporting it in a composable way that actually made sense was way harder than I expected it to be. After about five false starts, we finally figured out an approach we liked, and now Tailwind CSS v3.0 includes colored shadows:"

Well wish granted — in Tailwind CSS v3.3 we’ve added a new 950 shade for every single color. In the grays they act as basically a tinted black, which is great for ultra dark UIs: And in the rest of the color spectrum we optimized 950 for high contrast text and tinted control backgrounds: Believe it or not the hardest part about this project was convincing ourselves to be okay with having 11 shades per color. Trying to make that look good in the color palette documentation was a nightmare. Also pour one out for the 50 shades of gray jokes we used to be able to make.

We’re handling this with the wonderful jiti library under the hood, and using Sucrase to transpile the code with the best possible performance while keeping the installation footprint small. We’ve made it possible to style multi-directional websites using our LTR and RTL variants for a while, but now you can use logical properties to do most of this styling more easily and automatically.
