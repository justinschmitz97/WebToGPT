# chrome.accessibilityFeatures

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.accessibilityFeatures` API to manage Chrome's accessibility features. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/types/#ChromeSetting) for getting and setting individual accessibility features. In order to get feature states the extension must request `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission. For modifying feature state, the extension needs `accessibilityFeatures.modify` permission. Note that `accessibilityFeatures.modify` does not imply `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission.

# chrome.action  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/

# chrome.action

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.action` API to control the extension's icon in the Google Chrome toolbar.

The action icons are displayed in the browser toolbar next to the [omnibox](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/omnibox). After installation, these appear in the extensions menu (the puzzle piece icon).
Users can pin your extension icon to the toolbar.
## Availability

Chrome 88+
MV3+

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"action"`  

To use the `chrome.action` API, specify a `"manifest_version"` of `3` and include
the `"action"` key in your [manifest file](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

```
{
  "name": "Action Extension",
  ...
  "action": {
    "default_icon": {              // optional
      "16": "images/icon16.png",   // optional
      "24": "images/icon24.png",   // optional
      "32": "images/icon32.png"    // optional
    },
    "default_title": "Click Me",   // optional, shown in tooltip
    "default_popup": "popup.html"  // optional
  },
  ...
}

```

The `"action"` key (along with its children) is optional. When it isn't included, your extension is still shown in the toolbar to provide access to the extension's menu. For this reason, we recommend that you always include at least the `"action"` and `"default_icon"` keys.

## Concepts and usage

### Parts of the UI

#### Icon

The icon is the main image on the toolbar for your extension, and is set by the `"default_icon"` key in
your manifest's `"action"` key. Icons must be 16 device-independent pixels (DIPs) wide and tall.

The `"default_icon"` key is a dictionary of sizes to image paths. Chrome uses these icons
to choose which image scale to use. If an exact match is not found, Chrome selects the closest
available and scales it to fit the image, which might affect image quality.

Because devices with less-common scale factors like 1.5x or 1.2x are becoming more
common, we encourage you to provide multiple sizes for your icons. This also
futureproofs your extension against potential icon display size changes. However,
if only providing a single size, the `"default_icon"` key can also be set to a
string with the path to a single icon instead of a dictionary.

You can also call `action.setIcon()` to set your extension's icon programmatically
by specifying a different image path or providing a dynamically-generated icon using the [HTML canvas
element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement), or, if setting from an extension service worker, the [offscreen
canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) API.

```
const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(16, 16);
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
context.clearRect(0, 0, 16, 16);
context.fillStyle = '#00FF00';  // Green
context.fillRect(0, 0, 16, 16);
const imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, 16, 16);
chrome.action.setIcon({imageData: imageData}, () => { /* ... */ });

```

For packed extensions (installed from a .crx file), images can be in most formats that the Blink
rendering engine can display, including PNG, JPEG, BMP, ICO, and others. SVG isn't supported.
Unpacked extensions must use PNG images.

#### Tooltip (title)

The tooltip, or title, appears when the user holds their mouse pointer over the extension's icon in the
toolbar. It's also included in the accessible text spoken by screen readers when the button gets
focus.

The default tooltip is set using the `"default_title"` field of the `"action"` key in `manifest.json`.
You can also set it programmatically by calling `action.setTitle()`.

#### Badge

Actions can optionally display a "badge" — a bit of text layered over the icon. This lets you
update the action to display a small amount of information about the state of the extension,
such as a counter. The badge has a text component and a background color. Because space is limited,
we recommend that badge text use four or fewer characters.

To create a badge, set it programmatically by calling `action.setBadgeBackgroundColor()` and
`action.setBadgeText()`. There isn't a default badge setting in the manifest. Badge color values
can be either an array of four integers between 0 and 255 that make up the RGBA color of the
badge or a string with a [CSS color](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/color) value.

```
chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: [0, 255, 0, 0]},  // Green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);

chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: '#00FF00'},  // Also green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);

chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: 'green'},  // Also, also green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);

```
#### Popup

An action's popup is shown when the user clicks on the extension's action button in the
toolbar. The popup can contain any HTML contents you like, and will be automatically sized to fit
its contents. The popup's size must be between 25x25 and 800x600 pixels.

The popup is initially set by the `"default_popup"` property in the `"action"` key in the
`manifest.json` file. If present, this property should point to a relative path within the extension
directory. It can also be updated dynamically to point to a different relative path using the
`action.setPopup()` method.

## Use cases

### Per-tab state

Extension actions can have different states for each tab. To set a value for an individual
tab, use the `tabId` property in the `action` API's setting methods. For example, to
set the badge text for a specific tab, do something like the following:

```
function getTabId() { /* ... */}
function getTabBadge() { /* ... */}

chrome.action.setBadgeText(
  {
    text: getTabBadge(tabId),
    tabId: getTabId(),
  },
  () => { ... }
);

```

If the `tabId` property is left out, the setting is treated as a global setting. Tab-specific
settings take priority over global settings.

### Enabled state

By default, toolbar actions are enabled (clickable) on every tab. You can change this default
by setting the `default_state` property in the `action` key of the manifest. If
`default_state` is set to `"disabled"`, the action is disabled by default and must be enabled
programmatically to be clickable. If `default_state` is set to `"enabled"` (the default),
the action is enabled and clickable by default.

You can control the state programmatically using the `action.enable()` and `action.disable()`
methods. This only affects whether the popup (if any) or `action.onClicked` event is sent
to your extension; it doesn't affect the action's presence in the toolbar.

## Examples

The following examples show some common ways that actions are used in extensions. To try this API,
install the [Action API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/action) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples)
repository.

### Show a popup

It's common for an extension to display a popup when the user clicks the extension's action. To
implement this in your own extension, declare the popup in your `manifest.json` and specify the
content that Chrome should display in the popup.

```
// manifest.json
{
  "name": "Action popup demo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Click to view a popup",
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
}

```
```
<!-- popup.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    html {
      min-height: 5em;
      min-width: 10em;
      background: salmon;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</body>
</html>

```
### Inject a content script on click

A common pattern for extensions is to expose their primary feature using the extension's
action. The following example demonstrates this pattern. When the user clicks the action, the extension
injects a content script into the current page. The content script then displays an alert to verify
that everything worked as expected.

```
// manifest.json
{
  "name": "Action script injection demo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Click to show an alert"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "scripting"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  }
}

```
```
// background.js
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: {tabId: tab.id},
    files: ['content.js']
  });
});

```
```
// content.js
alert('Hello, world!');

```
### Emulate actions with declarativeContent

This example shows how an extension's background logic can (a) disable an action by default and (b)
use [declarativeContent](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeContent) to enable the action on specific sites.

```
// service-worker.js

// Wrap in an onInstalled callback to avoid unnecessary work
// every time the service worker is run
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  // Page actions are disabled by default and enabled on select tabs
  chrome.action.disable();

  // Clear all rules to ensure only our expected rules are set
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, () => {
    // Declare a rule to enable the action on example.com pages
    let exampleRule = {
      conditions: [
        new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
          pageUrl: {hostSuffix: '.example.com'},
        })
      ],
      actions: [new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction()],
    };

    // Finally, apply our new array of rules
    let rules = [exampleRule];
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules(rules);
  });
});

```

# API reference

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Most extensions need access to one or more Chrome Extensions APIs to function. This API reference describes the APIs available
for use in extensions and presents example use cases.

## Common Extensions API features

An Extensions API consists of a namespace containing methods and properties for doing extensions work, and usually, but not
always, manifest fields for the `manifest.json` file. For example, the `chrome.action` namespace requires an `"action"` object
in the manifest. Many APIs also require [permissions](/docs/extensions/mv3/declare_permissions) in the manifest.

Methods in extension APIs are **asynchronous** unless stated otherwise. Asynchronous methods return immediately, without waiting
for the operation that calls them to finish. Use [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises) to get the results of these asynchronous methods.

## Chrome Extension APIs

[accessibilityFeatures](/docs/extensions/reference/api/accessibilityFeatures)

Use the `chrome.accessibilityFeatures` API to manage Chrome's accessibility features. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/types/#ChromeSetting) for getting and setting individual accessibility features. In order to get feature states the extension must request `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission. For modifying feature state, the extension needs `accessibilityFeatures.modify` permission. Note that `accessibilityFeatures.modify` does not imply `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission.

[action](/docs/extensions/reference/api/action)
Chrome 88+
MV3+

Use the `chrome.action` API to control the extension's icon in the Google Chrome toolbar.

[alarms](/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms)

Use the `chrome.alarms` API to schedule code to run periodically or at a specified time in the future.

[audio](/docs/extensions/reference/api/audio)
Chrome 59+
ChromeOS only

The `chrome.audio` API is provided to allow users to get information about and control the audio devices attached to the system. This API is currently only available in kiosk mode for ChromeOS.

[bookmarks](/docs/extensions/reference/api/bookmarks)

Use the `chrome.bookmarks` API to create, organize, and otherwise manipulate bookmarks. Also see [Override Pages](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/override), which you can use to create a custom Bookmark Manager page.

[browsingData](/docs/extensions/reference/api/browsingData)

Use the `chrome.browsingData` API to remove browsing data from a user's local profile.

[certificateProvider](/docs/extensions/reference/api/certificateProvider)
Chrome 46+
ChromeOS only

Use this API to expose certificates to the platform which can use these certificates for TLS authentications.

[commands](/docs/extensions/reference/api/commands)

Use the commands API to add keyboard shortcuts that trigger actions in your extension, for example, an action to open the browser action or send a command to the extension.

[contentSettings](/docs/extensions/reference/api/contentSettings)

Use the `chrome.contentSettings` API to change settings that control whether websites can use features such as cookies, JavaScript, and plugins. More generally speaking, content settings allow you to customize Chrome's behavior on a per-site basis instead of globally.

[contextMenus](/docs/extensions/reference/api/contextMenus)

Use the `chrome.contextMenus` API to add items to Google Chrome's context menu. You can choose what types of objects your context menu additions apply to, such as images, hyperlinks, and pages.

[cookies](/docs/extensions/reference/api/cookies)

Use the `chrome.cookies` API to query and modify cookies, and to be notified when they change.

[debugger](/docs/extensions/reference/api/debugger)

The `chrome.debugger` API serves as an alternate transport for Chrome's [remote debugging protocol](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol). Use `chrome.debugger` to attach to one or more tabs to instrument network interaction, debug JavaScript, mutate the DOM and CSS, and more. Use the [`Debuggee`](#type-Debuggee) property `tabId` to target tabs with `sendCommand` and route events by `tabId` from `onEvent` callbacks.

[declarativeContent](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeContent)

Use the `chrome.declarativeContent` API to take actions depending on the content of a page, without requiring permission to read the page's content.

[declarativeNetRequest](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest)
Chrome 84+

The `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` API is used to block or modify network requests by specifying declarative rules. This lets extensions modify network requests without intercepting them and viewing their content, thus providing more privacy.

[desktopCapture](/docs/extensions/reference/api/desktopCapture)

The Desktop Capture API captures the content of the screen, individual windows, or individual tabs.

[devtools.inspectedWindow](/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/inspectedWindow)

Use the `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow` API to interact with the inspected window: obtain the tab ID for the inspected page, evaluate the code in the context of the inspected window, reload the page, or obtain the list of resources within the page.

Use the `chrome.topSites` API to access the top sites (i.e. most visited sites) that are displayed on the new tab page. These do not include shortcuts customized by the user.

[tts](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts)

Use the `chrome.tts` API to play synthesized text-to-speech (TTS). See also the related [`ttsEngine`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/ttsEngine) API, which allows an extension to implement a speech engine.

[ttsEngine](/docs/extensions/reference/api/ttsEngine)

Use the `chrome.ttsEngine` API to implement a text-to-speech(TTS) engine using an extension. If your extension registers using this API, it will receive events containing an utterance to be spoken and other parameters when any extension or Chrome App uses the [`tts`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts) API to generate speech. Your extension can then use any available web technology to synthesize and output the speech, and send events back to the calling function to report the status.

[types](/docs/extensions/reference/api/types)

The `chrome.types` API contains type declarations for Chrome.

[userScripts](/docs/extensions/reference/api/userScripts)
Chrome 120+
MV3+

Use the `userScripts` API to execute user scripts in the User Scripts context.

[vpnProvider](/docs/extensions/reference/api/vpnProvider)
Chrome 43+
ChromeOS only

Use the `chrome.vpnProvider` API to implement a VPN client.

[wallpaper](/docs/extensions/reference/api/wallpaper)
Chrome 43+
ChromeOS only

Use the `chrome.wallpaper` API to change the ChromeOS wallpaper.

[webAuthenticationProxy](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webAuthenticationProxy)
Chrome 115+
MV3+

The `chrome.webAuthenticationProxy` API lets remote desktop software running on a remote host intercept Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) requests in order to handle them on a local client.

[webNavigation](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webNavigation)

Use the `chrome.webNavigation` API to receive notifications about the status of navigation requests in-flight.

[webRequest](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest)

Use the `chrome.webRequest` API to observe and analyze traffic and to intercept, block, or modify requests in-flight.

[windows](/docs/extensions/reference/api/windows)

Use the `chrome.windows` API to interact with browser windows. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange windows in the browser.

# chrome.accessibilityFeatures

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.accessibilityFeatures` API to manage Chrome's accessibility features. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/types/#ChromeSetting) for getting and setting individual accessibility features. In order to get feature states the extension must request `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission. For modifying feature state, the extension needs `accessibilityFeatures.modify` permission. Note that `accessibilityFeatures.modify` does not imply `accessibilityFeatures.read` permission.

# chrome.action  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/action

# chrome.action

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.action` API to control the extension's icon in the Google Chrome toolbar.

The action icons are displayed in the browser toolbar next to the [omnibox](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/omnibox). After installation, these appear in the extensions menu (the puzzle piece icon).
Users can pin your extension icon to the toolbar.
## Availability

Chrome 88+
MV3+

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"action"`  

To use the `chrome.action` API, specify a `"manifest_version"` of `3` and include
the `"action"` key in your [manifest file](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

```
{
  "name": "Action Extension",
  ...
  "action": {
    "default_icon": {              // optional
      "16": "images/icon16.png",   // optional
      "24": "images/icon24.png",   // optional
      "32": "images/icon32.png"    // optional
    },
    "default_title": "Click Me",   // optional, shown in tooltip
    "default_popup": "popup.html"  // optional
  },
  ...
}

```

The `"action"` key (along with its children) is optional. When it isn't included, your extension is still shown in the toolbar to provide access to the extension's menu. For this reason, we recommend that you always include at least the `"action"` and `"default_icon"` keys.

## Concepts and usage

### Parts of the UI

#### Icon

The icon is the main image on the toolbar for your extension, and is set by the `"default_icon"` key in
your manifest's `"action"` key. Icons must be 16 device-independent pixels (DIPs) wide and tall.

The `"default_icon"` key is a dictionary of sizes to image paths. Chrome uses these icons
to choose which image scale to use. If an exact match is not found, Chrome selects the closest
available and scales it to fit the image, which might affect image quality.

Because devices with less-common scale factors like 1.5x or 1.2x are becoming more
common, we encourage you to provide multiple sizes for your icons. This also
futureproofs your extension against potential icon display size changes. However,
if only providing a single size, the `"default_icon"` key can also be set to a
string with the path to a single icon instead of a dictionary.

You can also call `action.setIcon()` to set your extension's icon programmatically
by specifying a different image path or providing a dynamically-generated icon using the [HTML canvas
element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement), or, if setting from an extension service worker, the [offscreen
canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) API.

```
const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(16, 16);
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
context.clearRect(0, 0, 16, 16);
context.fillStyle = '#00FF00';  // Green
context.fillRect(0, 0, 16, 16);
const imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, 16, 16);
chrome.action.setIcon({imageData: imageData}, () => { /* ... */ });

```

For packed extensions (installed from a .crx file), images can be in most formats that the Blink
rendering engine can display, including PNG, JPEG, BMP, ICO, and others. SVG isn't supported.
Unpacked extensions must use PNG images.

#### Tooltip (title)

The tooltip, or title, appears when the user holds their mouse pointer over the extension's icon in the
toolbar. It's also included in the accessible text spoken by screen readers when the button gets
focus.

The default tooltip is set using the `"default_title"` field of the `"action"` key in `manifest.json`.
You can also set it programmatically by calling `action.setTitle()`.

#### Badge

Actions can optionally display a "badge" — a bit of text layered over the icon. This lets you
update the action to display a small amount of information about the state of the extension,
such as a counter. The badge has a text component and a background color. Because space is limited,
we recommend that badge text use four or fewer characters.

To create a badge, set it programmatically by calling `action.setBadgeBackgroundColor()` and
`action.setBadgeText()`. There isn't a default badge setting in the manifest. Badge color values
can be either an array of four integers between 0 and 255 that make up the RGBA color of the
badge or a string with a [CSS color](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/color) value.

```
chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: [0, 255, 0, 0]},  // Green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);

chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: '#00FF00'},  // Also green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);

chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor(
  {color: 'green'},  // Also, also green
  () => { /* ... */ },
);

```
#### Popup

An action's popup is shown when the user clicks on the extension's action button in the
toolbar. The popup can contain any HTML contents you like, and will be automatically sized to fit
its contents. The popup's size must be between 25x25 and 800x600 pixels.

The popup is initially set by the `"default_popup"` property in the `"action"` key in the
`manifest.json` file. If present, this property should point to a relative path within the extension
directory. It can also be updated dynamically to point to a different relative path using the
`action.setPopup()` method.

## Use cases

### Per-tab state

Extension actions can have different states for each tab. To set a value for an individual
tab, use the `tabId` property in the `action` API's setting methods. For example, to
set the badge text for a specific tab, do something like the following:

```
function getTabId() { /* ... */}
function getTabBadge() { /* ... */}

chrome.action.setBadgeText(
  {
    text: getTabBadge(tabId),
    tabId: getTabId(),
  },
  () => { ... }
);

```

If the `tabId` property is left out, the setting is treated as a global setting. Tab-specific
settings take priority over global settings.

### Enabled state

By default, toolbar actions are enabled (clickable) on every tab. You can change this default
by setting the `default_state` property in the `action` key of the manifest. If
`default_state` is set to `"disabled"`, the action is disabled by default and must be enabled
programmatically to be clickable. If `default_state` is set to `"enabled"` (the default),
the action is enabled and clickable by default.

You can control the state programmatically using the `action.enable()` and `action.disable()`
methods. This only affects whether the popup (if any) or `action.onClicked` event is sent
to your extension; it doesn't affect the action's presence in the toolbar.

## Examples

The following examples show some common ways that actions are used in extensions. To try this API,
install the [Action API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/action) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples)
repository.

### Show a popup

It's common for an extension to display a popup when the user clicks the extension's action. To
implement this in your own extension, declare the popup in your `manifest.json` and specify the
content that Chrome should display in the popup.

```
// manifest.json
{
  "name": "Action popup demo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Click to view a popup",
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
}

```
```
<!-- popup.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    html {
      min-height: 5em;
      min-width: 10em;
      background: salmon;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</body>
</html>

```
### Inject a content script on click

A common pattern for extensions is to expose their primary feature using the extension's
action. The following example demonstrates this pattern. When the user clicks the action, the extension
injects a content script into the current page. The content script then displays an alert to verify
that everything worked as expected.

```
// manifest.json
{
  "name": "Action script injection demo",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Click to show an alert"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "scripting"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  }
}

```
```
// background.js
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: {tabId: tab.id},
    files: ['content.js']
  });
});

```
```
// content.js
alert('Hello, world!');

```
### Emulate actions with declarativeContent

This example shows how an extension's background logic can (a) disable an action by default and (b)
use [declarativeContent](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeContent) to enable the action on specific sites.

```
// service-worker.js

// Wrap in an onInstalled callback to avoid unnecessary work
// every time the service worker is run
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  // Page actions are disabled by default and enabled on select tabs
  chrome.action.disable();

  // Clear all rules to ensure only our expected rules are set
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, () => {
    // Declare a rule to enable the action on example.com pages
    let exampleRule = {
      conditions: [
        new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
          pageUrl: {hostSuffix: '.example.com'},
        })
      ],
      actions: [new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction()],
    };

    // Finally, apply our new array of rules
    let rules = [exampleRule];
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules(rules);
  });
});

```

# chrome.alarms  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms

# chrome.alarms

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.alarms` API to schedule code to run periodically or at a specified time in the future.

## Permissions

`alarms`  

To use the `chrome.alarms` API, declare the `"alarms"` permission in the [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest):

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "alarms"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

To ensure reliable behavior, it is helpful to understand how the API behaves.

### Device sleep

Alarms continue to run while a device is sleeping. However, an alarm will not
wake up a device. When the device wakes up, any missed alarms will fire.
Repeating alarms will fire at most once and then be rescheduled using the
specified period starting from when the device wakes, not taking into account
any time that has already elapsed since the alarm was originally set to run.

### Persistence

Alarms generally persist until an extension is updated. However, this is not guaranteed, and alarms
may be cleared when the browser is restarted. Consequently, consider setting a value in storage
when an alarm is created, and then ensure it exists each time your service worker starts up. For example:

```
const STORAGE_KEY = "user-preference-alarm-enabled";

async function checkAlarmState() {
  const { alarmEnabled } = await chrome.storage.get(STORAGE_KEY);

  if (alarmEnabled) {
    const alarm = await chrome.alarms.get("my-alarm");

    if (!alarm) {
      await chrome.alarms.create({ periodInMinutes: 1 });
    }
  }
}

checkAlarmState();

```
## Examples

The following examples show how to use and respond to an alarm. To try this API,
install the [Alarm API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/alarms) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples)
repository.

### Set an alarm

The following example sets an alarm in the service worker when the extension is installed:

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(async ({ reason }) => {
  if (reason !== 'install') {
    return;
  }

  // Create an alarm so we have something to look at in the demo
  await chrome.alarms.create('demo-default-alarm', {
    delayInMinutes: 1,
    periodInMinutes: 1
  });
});

```
### Respond to an alarm

The following example sets the [action toolbar icon](/docs/extensions/reference/api/action#icon) based on the name of the alarm that went off.

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener((alarm) => {
  chrome.action.setIcon({
    path: getIconPath(alarm.name),
  });
});

```
## Types

### Alarm

#### Properties

* name

  string

  Name of this alarm.
* periodInMinutes

  number optional

  If not null, the alarm is a repeating alarm and will fire again in `periodInMinutes` minutes.
* scheduledTime

  number

  Time at which this alarm was scheduled to fire, in milliseconds past the epoch (e.g. `Date.now() + n`). For performance reasons, the alarm may have been delayed an arbitrary amount beyond this.
### AlarmCreateInfo

#### Properties

* delayInMinutes

  number optional

  Length of time in minutes after which the `onAlarm` event should fire.
* periodInMinutes

  number optional

  If set, the onAlarm event should fire every `periodInMinutes` minutes after the initial event specified by `when` or `delayInMinutes`. If not set, the alarm will only fire once.
* when

  number optional

  Time at which the alarm should fire, in milliseconds past the epoch (e.g. `Date.now() + n`).
## Methods

### clear()

Promise

```
chrome.alarms.clear(  
  name?: string,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Clears the alarm with the given name.

#### Parameters

* name

  string optional

  The name of the alarm to clear. Defaults to the empty string.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (wasCleared: boolean) => void
  ```

  + wasCleared

    boolean
#### Returns

* Promise<boolean>

  Chrome 91+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### clearAll()

Promise

```
chrome.alarms.clearAll(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Clears all alarms.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (wasCleared: boolean) => void
  ```

  + wasCleared

    boolean
#### Returns

* Promise<boolean>

  Chrome 91+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### create()

Promise

```
chrome.alarms.create(  
  name?: string,  
  alarmInfo: [AlarmCreateInfo](#type-AlarmCreateInfo),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Creates an alarm. Near the time(s) specified by `alarmInfo`, the `onAlarm` event is fired. If there is another alarm with the same name (or no name if none is specified), it will be cancelled and replaced by this alarm.

In order to reduce the load on the user's machine, Chrome limits alarms to at most once every 30 seconds but may delay them an arbitrary amount more. That is, setting `delayInMinutes` or `periodInMinutes` to less than `0.5` will not be honored and will cause a warning. `when` can be set to less than 30 seconds after "now" without warning but won't actually cause the alarm to fire for at least 30 seconds.

To help you debug your app or extension, when you've loaded it unpacked, there's no limit to how often the alarm can fire.

#### Parameters

* name

  string optional

  Optional name to identify this alarm. Defaults to the empty string.
* alarmInfo

  [AlarmCreateInfo](#type-AlarmCreateInfo)

  Describes when the alarm should fire. The initial time must be specified by either `when` or `delayInMinutes` (but not both). If `periodInMinutes` is set, the alarm will repeat every `periodInMinutes` minutes after the initial event. If neither `when` or `delayInMinutes` is set for a repeating alarm, `periodInMinutes` is used as the default for `delayInMinutes`.
* callback

  function optional

  Chrome 111+

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 111+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

# chrome.bookmarks  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/bookmarks

# chrome.bookmarks

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.bookmarks` API to create, organize, and otherwise manipulate bookmarks. Also see [Override Pages](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/override), which you can use to create a custom Bookmark Manager page.

## Permissions

`bookmarks`  

You must declare the "bookmarks" permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use the bookmarks API.
For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "bookmarks"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Objects and properties

Bookmarks are organized in a tree, where each node in the tree is either a bookmark or a folder
(sometimes called a *group*). Each node in the tree is represented by a
[bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode](#type-BookmarkTreeNode) object.

`BookmarkTreeNode` properties are used throughout the `chrome.bookmarks` API. For example, when you
call [bookmarks.create](#method-create), you pass in the new node's parent (`parentId`), and, optionally, the
node's `index`, `title`, and `url` properties. See [bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode](#type-BookmarkTreeNode) for information
about the properties a node can have.

### Examples

The following code creates a folder with the title "Extension bookmarks". The first argument to
`create()` specifies properties for the new folder. The second argument defines a function to be
executed after the folder is created.

```
chrome.bookmarks.create(
  {'parentId': bookmarkBar.id, 'title': 'Extension bookmarks'},
  function(newFolder) {
    console.log("added folder: " + newFolder.title);
  },
);

```

The next snippet creates a bookmark pointing to the developer documentation for extensions. Since
nothing bad will happen if creating the bookmark fails, this code doesn't bother to define a
callback function.

```
chrome.bookmarks.create({
  'parentId': extensionsFolderId,
  'title': 'Extensions doc',
  'url': 'https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions',
});

```

To try this API, install the [Bookmarks API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/bookmarks) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

### BookmarkTreeNode

A node (either a bookmark or a folder) in the bookmark tree. Child nodes are ordered within their parent folder.

# chrome.browsingData  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/browsingData

# chrome.browsingData

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.browsingData` API to remove browsing data from a user's local profile.

## Permissions

`browsingData`  

You must declare the `"browsingData"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use this API.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "browsingData",
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

The simplest use-case for this API is a a time-based mechanism for clearing a user's browsing data.
Your code should provide a timestamp which indicates the historical date after which the user's
browsing data should be removed. This timestamp is formatted as the number of milliseconds since the
Unix epoch (which can be retrieved from a JavaScript `Date` object using the `getTime()` method).

For example, to clear all of a user's browsing data from the last week, you might write code as
follows:

```
var callback = function () {
  // Do something clever here once data has been removed.
};

var millisecondsPerWeek = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
var oneWeekAgo = (new Date()).getTime() - millisecondsPerWeek;
chrome.browsingData.remove({
  "since": oneWeekAgo
}, {
  "appcache": true,
  "cache": true,
  "cacheStorage": true,
  "cookies": true,
  "downloads": true,
  "fileSystems": true,
  "formData": true,
  "history": true,
  "indexedDB": true,
  "localStorage": true,
  "passwords": true,
  "serviceWorkers": true,
  "webSQL": true
}, callback);

```

The `chrome.browsingData.remove()` method lets you remove various types of browsing data with a
single call, and will be much faster than calling multiple more specific methods. If, however, you
only want to clear one specific type of browsing data (cookies, for example), the more granular
methods offer a readable alternative to a call filled with JSON.

```
var callback = function () {
  // Do something clever here once data has been removed.
};

var millisecondsPerWeek = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
var oneWeekAgo = (new Date()).getTime() - millisecondsPerWeek;
chrome.browsingData.removeCookies({
  "since": oneWeekAgo
}, callback);

```

If the user is syncing their data, `chrome.browsingData.remove()` may automatically rebuild the cookie
for the Sync account after clearing it. This is to ensure that Sync can continue working, so that
the data can be eventually deleted on the server. However the more specific
`chrome.browsingData.removeCookies()` can be used to clear the cookie for the Sync account, and Sync
will be paused in this case.

### Specific origins

To remove data for a specific origin or to exclude a set of origins from deletion, you can use the
`RemovalOptions.origins` and `RemovalOptions.excludeOrigins` parameters. They can only be applied to
cookies, cache, and storage (CacheStorage, FileSystems, IndexedDB, LocalStorage, ServiceWorkers, and
WebSQL).

```
chrome.browsingData.remove({
  "origins": ["https://www.example.com"]
}, {
  "cacheStorage": true,
  "cookies": true,
  "fileSystems": true,
  "indexedDB": true,
  "localStorage": true,
  "serviceWorkers": true,
  "webSQL": true
}, callback);

```
### Origin types

Adding an `originTypes` property to the APIs options object lets you specify which types of
origins ought to be effected. Origins are divided into three categories:

* `unprotectedWeb` covers the general case of websites that users visit without taking any special
  action. If you don't specify an `originTypes`, the API defaults to removing data from unprotected
  web origins.
* `protectedWeb` covers those web origins that have been installed as hosted applications.
  Installing [Angry Birds](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aknpkdffaafgjchaibgeefbgmgeghloj), for example, protects the origin `https://chrome.angrybirds.com`, and
  removes it from the `unprotectedWeb` category. Be careful when triggering deletion of
  data for these origins: make sure your users know what they're getting, as this will irrevocably
  remove their game data. No one wants to knock tiny pig houses over more often than necessary.
* `extension` covers origins under the `chrome-extensions:` scheme. Removing extension data is,
  again, something you should be very careful about.

We could adjust the previous example to remove only data from protected websites as follows:

```
var callback = function () {
  // Do something clever here once data has been removed.
};

var millisecondsPerWeek = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
var oneWeekAgo = (new Date()).getTime() - millisecondsPerWeek;
chrome.browsingData.remove({
  "since": oneWeekAgo,
  "originTypes": {
    "protectedWeb": true
  }
}, {
  "appcache": true,
  "cache": true,
  "cacheStorage": true,
  "cookies": true,
  "downloads": true,
  "fileSystems": true,
  "formData": true,
  "history": true,
  "indexedDB": true,
  "localStorage": true,
  "passwords": true,
  "serviceWorkers": true,
  "webSQL": true
}, callback);

```

# chrome.certificateProvider

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use this API to expose certificates to the platform which can use these certificates for TLS authentications.

## Permissions

`certificateProvider`  
## Availability

Chrome 46+
ChromeOS only

## Concepts and usage

Typical usage of this API to expose client certificates to ChromeOS follows these steps:

* The Extension registers for the events [`onCertificatesUpdateRequested`](#event-onCertificatesUpdateRequested) and [`onSignatureRequested`](#event-onSignatureRequested).
* The Extension calls [`setCertificates()`](#method-setCertificates) to provide the initial list of certificates after the initialization.
* The Extension monitors the changes in the list of available certificates and calls [`setCertificates()`](#method-setCertificates) to notify the browser about every such change.
* During a TLS handshake, the browser receives a client certificate request. With an [`onCertificatesUpdateRequested`](#event-onCertificatesUpdateRequested) event, the browser asks the Extension to report all certificates that it currently provides.
* The Extension reports back with the currently available certificates, using the [`setCertificates()`](#method-setCertificates) method.
* The browser matches all available certificates with the client certificate request from the remote host. The matches are presented to the user in a selection dialog.
* The user can select a certificate and thereby approve the authentication or abort the authentication.

* If the user aborts the authentication or no certificate matched the request, the TLS client authentication is aborted.
* Otherwise, if the user approves the authentication with a certificate provided by this Extension, the browser requests the Extension to sign the data to continue the TLS handshake. The request is sent as a [`onSignatureRequested`](#event-onSignatureRequested) event.
* This event contains input data, declares which algorithm has to be used to generate the signature, and refers to one of the certificates that were reported by this Extension. The Extension must create a signature for the given data using the private key associated with the referenced certificate. Creating the signature might require prepending a DigestInfo and padding the result before the actual signing.
* The Extension sends back the signature to the browser using the [`reportSignature()`](#method-reportSignature) method. If the signature couldn't be calculated, the method has to be called without signature.
* If the signature was provided, the browser completes the TLS handshake.

The actual sequence of steps can be different. For example, the user will not be asked to select a certificate if the enterprise policy to automatically select a certificate is used (see [`AutoSelectCertificateForUrls`](https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=AutoSelectCertificateForUrls) and [Chrome policies for users](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2657289#AutoSelectCertificateForUrls)).

In the Extension, this can look similar to the following snippet:

```
function collectAvailableCertificates() {
  // Return all certificates that this Extension can currently provide.
  // For example:
  return [{
    certificateChain: [new Uint8Array(...)],
    supportedAlgorithms: ['RSASSA_PKCS1_v1_5_SHA256']
  }];
}

// The Extension calls this function every time the currently available list of
// certificates changes, and also once after the Extension's initialization.
function onAvailableCertificatesChanged() {
  chrome.certificateProvider.setCertificates({
    clientCertificates: collectAvailableCertificates()
  });
}

function handleCertificatesUpdateRequest(request) {
  // Report the currently available certificates as a response to the request
  // event. This is important for supporting the case when the Extension is
  // unable to detect the changes proactively.
  chrome.certificateProvider.setCertificates({
    certificatesRequestId: request.certificatesRequestId,
    clientCertificates: collectAvailableCertificates()
  });
}

// Returns a private key handle for the given DER-encoded certificate.
// |certificate| is an ArrayBuffer.
function getPrivateKeyHandle(certificate) {...}

// Digests and signs |input| with the given private key. |input| is an
// ArrayBuffer. |algorithm| is an Algorithm.
// Returns the signature as ArrayBuffer.
function signUnhashedData(privateKey, input, algorithm) {...}

function handleSignatureRequest(request) {
  // Look up the handle to the private key of |request.certificate|.
  const key = getPrivateKeyHandle(request.certificate);
  if (!key) {
    // Handle if the key isn't available.
    console.error('Key for requested certificate no available.');

    // Abort the request by reporting the error to the API.
    chrome.certificateProvider.reportSignature({
      signRequestId: request.signRequestId,
      error: 'GENERAL_ERROR'
    });
    return;
  }

  const signature = signUnhashedData(key, request.input, request.algorithm);
  chrome.certificateProvider.reportSignature({
    signRequestId: request.signRequestId,
    signature: signature
  });
}

chrome.certificateProvider.onCertificatesUpdateRequested.addListener(
    handleCertificatesUpdateRequest);
chrome.certificateProvider.onSignatureRequested.addListener(
    handleSignatureRequest);

```

  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onCertificatesUpdateRequested

Chrome 86+

```
chrome.certificateProvider.onCertificatesUpdateRequested.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

This event fires if the certificates set via [`setCertificates`](#method-setCertificates) are insufficient or the browser requests updated information. The extension must call [`setCertificates`](#method-setCertificates) with the updated list of certificates and the received `certificatesRequestId`.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (request: [CertificatesUpdateRequest](#type-CertificatesUpdateRequest)) => void
  ```

  + request

    [CertificatesUpdateRequest](#type-CertificatesUpdateRequest)
### onSignatureRequested

Chrome 86+

```
chrome.certificateProvider.onSignatureRequested.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

This event fires every time the browser needs to sign a message using a certificate provided by this extension via [`setCertificates`](#method-setCertificates).

The extension must sign the input data from `request` using the appropriate algorithm and private key and return it by calling [`reportSignature`](#method-reportSignature) with the received `signRequestId`.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (request: [SignatureRequest](#type-SignatureRequest)) => void
  ```

  + request

    [SignatureRequest](#type-SignatureRequest)

# chrome.commands  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/commands

# chrome.commands

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the commands API to add keyboard shortcuts that trigger actions in your extension, for example, an action to open the browser action or send a command to the extension.

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"commands"`  
## Concepts and usage

The Commands API allows extension developers to define specific commands, and bind them to a default
key combination. Each command an extension accepts must be declared as properties of the
`"commands"` object in the [extension's manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

The property key is used as the command's name. Command objects can take two properties.

`suggested_key`

An optional property that declares default keyboard shortcuts for the command. If omitted, the
command will be unbound. This property can either take a string or an object value.

* **A string value** specifies the default keyboard shortcut that should be used across all
  platforms.
* **An object value** allows the extension developer to customize the keyboard shortcut for each
  platform. When providing platform-specific shortcuts, valid object properties are `default`,
  `chromeos`, `linux`, `mac`, and `windows`.

See [Key combination requirements](#key-combinations) for additional details.

`description`

A string used to provide the user with a short description of the command's purpose. This string
appears in extension keyboard shortcut management UI. Descriptions are required for standard
commands, but are ignored for [Action commands](#action_commands).

An extension can have many commands, but may specify at most four suggested keyboard shortcuts. The
user can manually add more shortcuts from the `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` dialog.

### Supported Keys

The following keys are usable command shortcuts. Key definitions are case sensitive. Attempting to
load an extension with an incorrectly cased key will result in a manifest parse error at
installation time.

Alpha keys
`A` … `Z`
Numeric keys
`0` … `9`
Standard key strings

General–`Comma`, `Period`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Space`, `Insert`, `Delete`

Arrow keys–`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`

Media Keys–`MediaNextTrack`, `MediaPlayPause`, `MediaPrevTrack`, `MediaStop`

Modifier key strings

`Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, `MacCtrl` (macOS only), `Command` (macOS only), `Search` (ChromeOS only)

### Key combination requirements

* Extension command shortcuts must include either `Ctrl` or `Alt`.

  + Modifiers **cannot** be used in combination with Media Keys.
  + On many macOS keyboards, `Alt` refers to the Option key.
  + On macOS, `Command` or `MacCtrl` can also be used in place of `Ctrl` or `Alt` (see next bullet point).
* On macOS `Ctrl` is automatically converted into `Command`.

  + `Command` can also be used in the `"mac"` shortcut to explicitly refer to the Command key.
  + To use the Control key on macOS, replace `Ctrl` with `MacCtrl` when defining the `"mac"`
    shortcut.
  + Using `MacCtrl` in the combination for another platform will cause a validation error and prevent the extension from being installed.
* `Shift` is an optional modifier on all platforms.
* `Search` is an optional modifier exclusive to ChromeOS.
* Certain operating system and Chrome shortcuts (e.g. window management) always take priority over
  Extension command shortcuts and cannot be overridden.

### Handle command events

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "commands": {
    "run-foo": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "default": "Ctrl+Shift+Y",
        "mac": "Command+Shift+Y"
      },
      "description": "Run \"foo\" on the current page."
    },
    "_execute_action": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "windows": "Ctrl+Shift+Y",
        "mac": "Command+Shift+Y",
        "chromeos": "Ctrl+Shift+U",
        "linux": "Ctrl+Shift+J"
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}

```

In your service worker, you can bind a handler to each of the commands defined in the manifest
using `onCommand.addListener`. For example:

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.commands.onCommand.addListener((command) => {
  console.log(`Command: ${command}`);
});

```
### Action commands

The `_execute_action` (Manifest V3), `_execute_browser_action` (Manifest V2), and
`_execute_page_action` (Manifest V2) commands are reserved for the action of trigger your action,
browser action, or page action respectively. These commands don't dispatch
[command.onCommand](#event-onCommand) events like standard commands.

If you need to take action based on your popup opening, consider listening for a
[DOMContentLoaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event) event inside your popup's JavaScript.

### Scope

By default, commands are scoped to the Chrome browser. This means that when the browser does not
have focus, command shortcuts are inactive. Beginning in Chrome 35, extension developers can
optionally mark a command as "global". Global commands also work while Chrome *does not* have focus.

Keyboard shortcut suggestions for global commands are limited to `Ctrl+Shift+[0..9]`. This is a
protective measure to minimize the risk of overriding shortcuts in other applications since if, for
example, `Alt+P` were to be allowed as global, the keyboard shortcut for opening a print dialog
might not work in other applications.

End users are free to remap global commands to their preferred key combination using the UI exposed
at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.

Example:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "commands": {
    "toggle-feature-foo": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "default": "Ctrl+Shift+5"
      },
      "description": "Toggle feature foo",
      "global": true
    }
  },
  ...
}

```
## Examples

The following examples flex the core functionality of the Commands API.

### Basic command

Commands allow extensions to map logic to keyboard shortcuts that can be invoked by the user. At its
most basic, a command only requires a command declaration in the extension's manifest and a listener
registration as shown in the following example.

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "Command demo - basic",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "service-worker.js"
  },
  "commands": {
    "inject-script": {
      "suggested_key": "Ctrl+Shift+Y",
      "description": "Inject a script on the page"
    }
  }
}

```

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.commands.onCommand.addListener((command) => {
  console.log(`Command "${command}" triggered`);
});

```
### Action command

As described in the [Concepts and usage](#concepts_and_usage) section, you can also map a command to an extension's
action. The following example injects a content script that shows an
alert on the current page when the user either clicks the extension's action or triggers the
keyboard shortcut.

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "Commands demo - action invocation",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "service-worker.js"
  },
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "scripting"],
  "action": {},
  "commands": {
    "_execute_action": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "default": "Ctrl+U",
        "mac": "Command+U"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: {tabId: tab.id},
    func: contentScriptFunc,
    args: ['action'],
  });
});

function contentScriptFunc(name) {
  alert(`"${name}" executed`);
}

// This callback WILL NOT be called for "_execute_action"
chrome.commands.onCommand.addListener((command) => {
  console.log(`Command "${command}" called`);
});

```
### Verify commands registered

If an extension attempts to register a shortcut that is already used by another extension, the
second extension's shortcut won't register as expected. You can provide a more robust end user
experience by anticipating this possibility and checking for collisions at install time.

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener((details) => {
  if (details.reason === chrome.runtime.OnInstalledReason.INSTALL) {
    checkCommandShortcuts();
  }
});

// Only use this function during the initial install phase. After
// installation the user may have intentionally unassigned commands.
function checkCommandShortcuts() {
  chrome.commands.getAll((commands) => {
    let missingShortcuts = [];

    for (let {name, shortcut} of commands) {
      if (shortcut === '') {
        missingShortcuts.push(name);
      }
    }

    if (missingShortcuts.length > 0) {
      // Update the extension UI to inform the user that one or more
      // commands are currently unassigned.
    }
  });
}

```

# chrome.contentSettings  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/contentSettings

# chrome.contentSettings

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.contentSettings` API to change settings that control whether websites can use features such as cookies, JavaScript, and plugins. More generally speaking, content settings allow you to customize Chrome's behavior on a per-site basis instead of globally.

## Permissions

`contentSettings`  

You must declare the `"contentSettings"` permission in your extension's manifest to use the API. For
example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "contentSettings"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Content setting patterns

You can use patterns to specify the websites that each content setting affects. For example,
`https://*.youtube.com/*` specifies youtube.com and all of its subdomains. The syntax for content
setting patterns is the same as for [match patterns](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns), with a few differences:

* For `http`, `https`, and `ftp` URLs, the path must be a wildcard (`/*`). For `file` URLs, the path
  must be completely specified and **must not** contain wildcards.
* In contrast to match patterns, content setting patterns can specify a port number. If a port
  number is specified, the pattern only matches websites with that port. If no port number is
  specified, the pattern matches all ports.

### Pattern precedence

When more than one content setting rule applies for a given site, the rule with the more specific
pattern takes precedence.

For example, the following patterns are ordered by precedence:

1. `https://www.example.com/*`
2. `https://*.example.com/*` (matching example.com and all subdomains)
3. `<all_urls>` (matching every URL)

Three kinds of wildcards affect how specific a pattern is:

* Wildcards in the port (for example `https://www.example.com:*/*`)
* Wildcards in the scheme (for example `*://www.example.com:123/*`)
* Wildcards in the hostname (for example `https://*.example.com:123/*`)

If a pattern is more specific than another pattern in one part but less specific in another part,
the different parts are checked in the following order: hostname, scheme, port. For example, the
following patterns are ordered by precedence:

1. `https://www.example.com:*/*`
   Specifies the hostname and scheme.
2. `*:/www.example.com:123/*`
   Not as high, because although it specifies the hostname, it doesn't specify the scheme.
3. `https://*.example.com:123/*`
   Lower because although it specifies the port and scheme, it has a wildcard in the hostname.

### Primary and secondary patterns

The URL taken into account when deciding which content setting to apply depends on the content type.
For example, for [`contentSettings.notifications`](#property-notifications) settings are based on the URL shown in the
omnibox. This URL is called the "primary" URL.

Some content types can take additional URLs into account. For example, whether a site is allowed to
set a [`contentSettings.cookies`](#property-cookies) is decided based on the URL of the HTTP request (which is the
primary URL in this case) as well as the URL shown in the omnibox (which is called the "secondary"
URL).

If multiple rules have primary and secondary patterns, the rule with the more specific primary
pattern takes precedence. If there multiple rules have the same primary pattern, the rule with the
more specific secondary pattern takes precedence. For example, the following list of
primary/secondary pattern pairs is ordered by precedence:

| Precedence | Primary pattern | Secondary pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `https://www.moose.com/*`, | `https://www.wombat.com/*` |
| 2 | `https://www.moose.com/*`, | `<all_urls>` |
| 3 | `<all_urls>`, | `https://www.wombat.com/*` |
| 4 | `<all_urls>`, | `<all_urls>` |

Secondary patterns are not supported for the images content setting.

### Resource identifiers

Resource identifiers allow you to specify content settings for specific subtypes of a content type.
Currently, the only content type that supports resource identifiers is [`contentSettings.plugins`](#property-plugins),
where a resource identifier identifies a specific plugin. When applying content settings, first the
settings for the specific plugin are checked. If there are no settings found for the specific
plugin, the general content settings for plugins are checked.

For example, if a content setting rule has the resource identifier `adobe-flash-player` and the
pattern `<all_urls>`, it takes precedence over a rule without a resource identifier and the pattern
`https://www.example.com/*`, even if that pattern is more specific.

You can get a list of resource identifiers for a content type by calling the
[`contentSettings.ContentSetting.getResourceIdentifiers()`](#method-ContentSetting-getResourceIdentifiers) method. The returned list can change with
the set of installed plugins on the user's machine, but Chrome tries to keep the identifiers stable
across plugin updates.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [contentSettings API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/contentSettings) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)

# chrome.contextMenus  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/contextMenus

# chrome.contextMenus

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.contextMenus` API to add items to Google Chrome's context menu. You can choose what types of objects your context menu additions apply to, such as images, hyperlinks, and pages.

## Permissions

`contextMenus`  

You must declare the `"contextMenus"` permission in your extension's manifest to use the API. Also,
you should specify a 16 by 16-pixel icon for display next to your menu item. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "contextMenus"
  ],
  "icons": {
    "16": "icon-bitty.png",
    "48": "icon-small.png",
    "128": "icon-large.png"
  },
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

Context menu items can appear in any document (or frame within a document), even those with file://
or chrome:// URLs. To control which documents your items can appear in, specify the
`documentUrlPatterns` field when you call the `create()` or `update()` methods.

You can create as many context menu items as you need, but if more than one from your extension is
visible at once, Google Chrome automatically collapses them into a single parent menu.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [contextMenus API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/contextMenus) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

### ContextType

Chrome 44+

The different contexts a menu can appear in. Specifying 'all' is equivalent to the combination of all other contexts except for 'launcher'. The 'launcher' context is only supported by apps and is used to add menu items to the context menu that appears when clicking the app icon in the launcher/taskbar/dock/etc. Different platforms might put limitations on what is actually supported in a launcher context menu.

#### Enum

"all"   

"page"   

"frame"   

"selection"   

"link"   

"editable"   

"image"   

"video"   

"audio"   

"launcher"   

"browser\_action"   

"page\_action"   

"action"   

### CreateProperties

Chrome 123+

Properties of the new context menu item.

#### Properties

* checked

  boolean optional

  The initial state of a checkbox or radio button: `true` for selected, `false` for unselected. Only one radio button can be selected at a time in a given group.
* contexts

  [[ContextType](#type-ContextType), ...[ContextType](#type-ContextType)[]] optional

  List of contexts this menu item will appear in. Defaults to `['page']`.
* documentUrlPatterns

  string[] optional

  Restricts the item to apply only to documents or frames whose URL matches one of the given patterns. For details on pattern formats, see [Match Patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns).
* enabled

  boolean optional

  Whether this context menu item is enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`.
* id

  string optional

  The unique ID to assign to this item. Mandatory for event pages. Cannot be the same as another ID for this extension.
* parentId

  string | number optional

  Similar to `documentUrlPatterns`, filters based on the `src` attribute of `img`, `audio`, and `video` tags and the `href` attribute of `a` tags.
* title

  string optional

  The text to display in the item; this is *required* unless `type` is `separator`. When the context is `selection`, use `%s` within the string to show the selected text. For example, if this parameter's value is "Translate '%s' to Pig Latin" and the user selects the word "cool", the context menu item for the selection is "Translate 'cool' to Pig Latin".
* type

  [ItemType](#type-ItemType) optional

  The type of menu item. Defaults to `normal`.
* visible

  boolean optional

  Whether the item is visible in the menu.
* onclick

# chrome.cookies  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/cookies

# chrome.cookies

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.cookies` API to query and modify cookies, and to be notified when they change.

## Permissions

`cookies`  

To use the cookies API, declare the `"cookies"` permission in your
manifest along with [host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) for any hosts whose cookies you want
to access. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.google.com/"
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "cookies"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Partitioning

[Partitioned cookies](/docs/privacy-sandbox/chips) allow a site to mark that certain cookies should be keyed against the
origin of the top-level frame. This means that, for example, if site A is embedded using an iframe in site B
and site C, the embedded versions of a partitioned cookie from A can have different values on B and C.

By default, all API methods operate on unpartitioned cookies. The
[`partitionKey`](#type-CookiePartitionKey) property can be used to override this behavior.

For details on the general impact of partitioning for extensions, see
[Storage and Cookies](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/storage-and-cookies#cookies-partitioning).

## Examples

You can find a simple example of using the cookies API in the
[examples/api/cookies](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/cookies/cookie-clearer) directory. For other examples and for help in viewing
the source code, see [Samples](/docs/extensions/samples).

## Types

### Cookie

Represents information about an HTTP cookie.

#### Properties

* domain

  string

  The domain of the cookie (e.g. "www.google.com", "example.com").
* expirationDate

  number optional

  The expiration date of the cookie as the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch. Not provided for session cookies.
* hostOnly

  boolean

  True if the cookie is a host-only cookie (i.e. a request's host must exactly match the domain of the cookie).
* httpOnly

  boolean

  True if the cookie is marked as HttpOnly (i.e. the cookie is inaccessible to client-side scripts).
* name

  string

  The name of the cookie.
* partitionKey

  [CookiePartitionKey](#type-CookiePartitionKey) optional

  Chrome 119+

  The partition key for reading or modifying cookies with the Partitioned attribute.
* path

  string

  The path of the cookie.
* sameSite

  [SameSiteStatus](#type-SameSiteStatus)

  Chrome 51+

  The cookie's same-site status (i.e. whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests).
* secure

  boolean

  True if the cookie is marked as Secure (i.e. its scope is limited to secure channels, typically HTTPS).
* session

  boolean

  True if the cookie is a session cookie, as opposed to a persistent cookie with an expiration date.
* storeId

  string

  The ID of the cookie store containing this cookie, as provided in getAllCookieStores().
* value

  string

  The value of the cookie.
### CookieDetails

Chrome 88+

Details to identify the cookie.

#### Properties

* name

  string

  The name of the cookie to access.
* partitionKey

  [CookiePartitionKey](#type-CookiePartitionKey) optional

  Chrome 119+

  The partition key for reading or modifying cookies with the Partitioned attribute.
* storeId

  string optional

  The ID of the cookie store in which to look for the cookie. By default, the current execution context's cookie store will be used.
* url

  string

  The URL with which the cookie to access is associated. This argument may be a full URL, in which case any data following the URL path (e.g. the query string) is simply ignored. If host permissions for this URL are not specified in the manifest file, the API call will fail.
### CookiePartitionKey

Chrome 119+

Represents a partitioned cookie's partition key.

#### Properties

* hasCrossSiteAncestor

  boolean optional

  Chrome 130+

  Indicates if the cookie was set in a cross-cross site context. This prevents a top-level site embedded in a cross-site context from accessing cookies set by the top-level site in a same-site context.
* topLevelSite

  string optional

  The top-level site the partitioned cookie is available in.
### CookieStore

Represents a cookie store in the browser. An incognito mode window, for instance, uses a separate cookie store from a non-incognito window.

#### Properties

  string

  The unique identifier for the cookie store.
* tabIds

  number[]

  Identifiers of all the browser tabs that share this cookie store.
### FrameDetails

Pending

Details to identify the frame.

#### Properties

* documentId

  string optional

  The unique identifier for the document. If the frameId and/or tabId are provided they will be validated to match the document found by provided document ID.
* frameId

  number optional

  The unique identifier for the frame within the tab.
* tabId

  number optional

  The unique identifier for the tab containing the frame.
### OnChangedCause

Chrome 44+

The underlying reason behind the cookie's change. If a cookie was inserted, or removed via an explicit call to "chrome.cookies.remove", "cause" will be "explicit". If a cookie was automatically removed due to expiry, "cause" will be "expired". If a cookie was removed due to being overwritten with an already-expired expiration date, "cause" will be set to "expired\_overwrite". If a cookie was automatically removed due to garbage collection, "cause" will be "evicted". If a cookie was automatically removed due to a "set" call that overwrote it, "cause" will be "overwrite". Plan your response accordingly.

#### Enum

"evicted"   

"expired"   

"explicit"   

"expired\_overwrite"   

"overwrite"   

### SameSiteStatus

Chrome 51+

A cookie's 'SameSite' state (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies). 'no\_restriction' corresponds to a cookie set with 'SameSite=None', 'lax' to 'SameSite=Lax', and 'strict' to 'SameSite=Strict'. 'unspecified' corresponds to a cookie set without the SameSite attribute.

#### Enum

"no\_restriction"   

"lax"   

"strict"   

"unspecified"   

## Methods

### get()

Promise

```
chrome.cookies.get(  
  details: [CookieDetails](#type-CookieDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Retrieves information about a single cookie. If more than one cookie of the same name exists for the given URL, the one with the longest path will be returned. For cookies with the same path length, the cookie with the earliest creation time will be returned.

# chrome.debugger  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/debugger

# chrome.debugger

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The `chrome.debugger` API serves as an alternate transport for Chrome's [remote debugging protocol](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol). Use `chrome.debugger` to attach to one or more tabs to instrument network interaction, debug JavaScript, mutate the DOM and CSS, and more. Use the [`Debuggee`](#type-Debuggee) property `tabId` to target tabs with `sendCommand` and route events by `tabId` from `onEvent` callbacks.

## Permissions

`debugger`  

You must declare the `"debugger"` permission in your extension's manifest to use this API.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "debugger",
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

Once attached, the `chrome.debugger` API lets you send [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/)
(CDP) commands to a given target. Explaining the CDP in depth is out of scope
for this documentation—to learn more about CDP check out the
[official CDP documentation](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

### Targets

Targets represent something which is being debugged—this could include a tab,
an iframe or a worker. Each target is identified by a UUID and has an associated
type (such as `iframe`, `shared_worker`, and more).

Within a target, there may be multiple execution contexts—for example same
process iframes don't get a unique target but are instead represented as
different contexts that can be accessed from a single target.

### Restricted domains

For security reasons, the `chrome.debugger` API does not provide access to all Chrome DevTools
Protocol Domains. The available domains are: [Accessibility](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Accessibility),
[Audits](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Audits), [CacheStorage](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/CacheStorage), [Console](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Console),
[CSS](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/CSS/), [Database](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Database), [Debugger](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Debugger), [DOM](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/DOM),
[DOMDebugger](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/DOMDebugger), [DOMSnapshot](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/DOMSnapshot),
[Emulation](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Emulation), [Fetch](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Fetch), [IO](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/IO), [Input](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Input),
[Inspector](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Inspector), [Log](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Log), [Network](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Network), [Overlay](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Overlay),
[Page](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page), [Performance](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Performance), [Profiler](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Profiler),
[Runtime](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Runtime), [Storage](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Storage), [Target](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Target), [Tracing](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Tracing),
[WebAudio](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/WebAudio), and [WebAuthn](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/WebAuthn).

### Work with frames

There is not a one to one mapping of frames to targets. Within a single tab,
multiple same process frames may share the same target but use a different
[execution context](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Runtime/#type-ExecutionContextId). On the other hand, a new target may be
created for an out-of-process iframe.

To attach to all frames, you need to handle each type of frame separately:

* Listen for the `Runtime.executionContextCreated` event to identify new
  execution contexts associated with same process frames.
* Follow the steps to [attach to related targets](#attach_to_related_targets) to
  identify out-of-process frames.

### Attach to related targets

After connecting to a target, you may want to connect to further related targets
including out-of-process child frames or associated workers.

Starting in Chrome 125, the `chrome.debugger` API supports flat sessions. This
lets you add additional targets as children to your main debugger session and
message them without needing another call to `chrome.debugger.attach`. Instead,
you can add a `sessionId` property when calling `chrome.debugger.sendCommand` to
identify the child target you would like to send a command to.

To automatically attach to out of process child frames, first add a listener for
the `Target.attachedToTarget` event:

```
chrome.debugger.onEvent.addListener((source, method, params) => {
  if (method === "Target.attachedToTarget") {
    // `source` identifies the parent session, but we need to construct a new
    // identifier for the child session
    const session = { ...source, sessionId: params.sessionId };

    // Call any needed CDP commands for the child session
    await chrome.debugger.sendCommand(session, "Runtime.enable");
  }
});

```

Then, enable [auto attach](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Target/#method-setAutoAttach) by sending the `Target.setAutoAttach` command with
the `flatten` option set to `true`:

```
await chrome.debugger.sendCommand({ tabId }, "Target.setAutoAttach", {
  autoAttach: true,
  waitForDebuggerOnStart: false,
  flatten: true,
  filter: [{ type: "iframe", exclude: false }]
});

```
## Examples

To try this API, install the [debugger API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/debugger) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)

# chrome.declarativeContent  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeContent

# chrome.declarativeContent

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.declarativeContent` API to take actions depending on the content of a page, without requiring permission to read the page's content.

## Permissions

`declarativeContent`  
## Concepts and usage

The Declarative Content API lets you enable your extension's action depending on the URL of a
web page, or if a CSS selector matches an element on the page, without needing to
add [host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions) or inject a [content script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts).

Use the [activeTab](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission to interact with a page after the user clicks on the
extension's action.

### Rules

Rules consists of conditions and actions. If any of the conditions is fulfilled, all actions are
executed. The actions are [`setIcon()`](#type-SetIcon) and [`showAction()`](#type-ShowAction).

The [`PageStateMatcher`](#type-PageStateMatcher) matches web pages if and only if all listed
criteria are met. It can match a [page url](#page-url), a [css compound selector](#css)
or the [bookmarked state](#bookmarked) of a page. The following rule enables
the extension's action on Google pages when a password field is present:

```
let rule1 = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      pageUrl: { hostSuffix: '.google.com', schemes: ['https'] },
      css: ["input[type='password']"]
    })
  ],
  actions: [ new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction() ]
};

```

To also enable the extension's action for Google sites with a video, you can add a second
condition, as each condition is sufficient to trigger all specified actions:

```
let rule2 = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      pageUrl: { hostSuffix: '.google.com', schemes: ['https'] },
      css: ["input[type='password']"]
    }),
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      css: ["video"]
    })
  ],
  actions: [ new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction() ]
};

```

The [`onPageChanged`](#event-onPageChanged) event tests whether any rule has at least one fulfilled
condition and executes the actions. Rules persist across browsing sessions; therefore, during
extension installation time you should first use [`removeRules`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#remove_rules) to clear
previously installed rules and then use [`addRules`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#add_rules) to register new ones.

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function(details) {
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, function() {
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([rule2]);
  });
});

```

With the [activeTab](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, your extension won't display any permission
warnings and when the user clicks the extension action, it will only run on relevant pages.

### Page URL matching

The [`PageStateMatcher.pageurl`](#property-PageStateMatcher-pageUrl) matches when the URL criteria are fulfilled. The
most common criteria are a concatenation of either host, path, or URL, followed by Contains, Equals, Prefix, or
Suffix. The following table contains a few examples:

| Criteria | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `{ hostSuffix: 'google.com' }` | All Google URLs |
| `{ pathPrefix: '/docs/extensions'` } | Extension docs URLs |
| `{ urlContains: 'developer.chrome.com'` } | All chrome developers docs URLs |

All criteria are case sensitive. For a complete list of criteria, see [UrlFilter](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#type-UrlFilter).

### CSS Matching

[`PageStateMatcher.css`](#property-PageStateMatcher-css) conditions must be *[compound selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#compound)*,
meaning that you can't include [combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors#combinators) like whitespace or "`>`" in your
selectors. This helps Chrome match the selectors more efficiently.

| Compound Selectors (OK) | Complex Selectors (Not OK) |
| --- | --- |
| `a` | `div p` |
| `iframe.special[src^='http']` | `p>span.highlight` |
| `ns|*` | `p + ol` |
| `#abcd:checked` | `p::first-line` |

CSS conditions only match displayed elements: if an element that matches your selector is
`display:none` or one of its parent elements is `display:none`, it doesn't cause the condition to
match. Elements styled with `visibility:hidden`, positioned off-screen, or hidden by other elements
can still make your condition match.

### Bookmarked state matching

The [`PageStateMatcher.isBookmarked`](#property-PageStateMatcher-isBookmarked) condition allows matching of the
bookmarked state of the current URL in the user's profile. To make use of this condition the
"bookmarks" permission must be declared in the extension [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

## Types

### ImageDataType

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData>.

#### Type

ImageData

### PageStateMatcher

Matches the state of a web page based on various criteria.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)
  + returns

    [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)
* css

  string[] optional

  Matches if all of the CSS selectors in the array match displayed elements in a frame with the same origin as the page's main frame. All selectors in this array must be [compound selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#compound) to speed up matching. Note: Listing hundreds of CSS selectors or listing CSS selectors that match hundreds of times per page can slow down web sites.
* isBookmarked

  boolean optional

  Chrome 45+

  Matches if the bookmarked state of the page is equal to the specified value. Requres the [bookmarks permission](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions).
* pageUrl

  [UrlFilter](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/events/#type-UrlFilter) optional

  Matches if the conditions of the `UrlFilter` are fulfilled for the top-level URL of the page.
### RequestContentScript

Declarative event action that injects a content script.

**WARNING:** This action is still experimental and is not supported on stable builds of Chrome.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)
  + returns

    [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)

  boolean optional

  Whether the content script runs in all frames of the matching page, or in only the top frame. Default is `false`.
* css

  string[] optional

  Names of CSS files to be injected as a part of the content script.
* js

  string[] optional

  Names of JavaScript files to be injected as a part of the content script.
* matchAboutBlank

  boolean optional

  Whether to insert the content script on `about:blank` and `about:srcdoc`. Default is `false`.
### SetIcon

Declarative event action that sets the n-dip square icon for the extension's [page action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/pageAction/) or [browser action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/) while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions), but the extension must have a page or browser action.

Exactly one of `imageData` or `path` must be specified. Both are dictionaries mapping a number of pixels to an image representation. The image representation in `imageData` is an [ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData) object; for example, from a `canvas` element, while the image representation in `path` is the path to an image file relative to the extension's manifest. If `scale` screen pixels fit into a device-independent pixel, the `scale * n` icon is used. If that scale is missing, another image is resized to the required size.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)
  + returns

    [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)
* imageData

  ImageData | object optional

  Either an `ImageData` object or a dictionary {size -> ImageData} representing an icon to be set. If the icon is specified as a dictionary, the image used is chosen depending on the screen's pixel density. If the number of image pixels that fit into one screen space unit equals `scale`, then an image with size `scale * n` is selected, where *n* is the size of the icon in the UI. At least one image must be specified. Note that `details.imageData = foo` is equivalent to `details.imageData = {'16': foo}`.
### ShowAction

Chrome 97+

A declarative event action that sets the extension's toolbar [action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/) to an enabled state while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions). If the extension has the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, clicking the page action grants access to the active tab.

On pages where the conditions are not met the extension's toolbar action will be grey-scale, and clicking it will open the context menu, instead of triggering the action.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)
  + returns

    [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)
### ShowPageAction

Deprecated since Chrome 97

Please use [`declarativeContent.ShowAction`](#type-ShowAction).

A declarative event action that sets the extension's [page action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/pageAction/) to an enabled state while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions), but the extension must have a page action. If the extension has the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, clicking the page action grants access to the active tab.

On pages where the conditions are not met the extension's toolbar action will be grey-scale, and clicking it will open the context menu, instead of triggering the action.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [ShowPageAction](#type-ShowPageAction)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [ShowPageAction](#type-ShowPageAction)
  + returns

    [ShowPageAction](#type-ShowPageAction)
## Events

# chrome.declarativeNetRequest  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest

# chrome.declarativeNetRequest

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` API is used to block or modify network requests by specifying declarative rules. This lets extensions modify network requests without intercepting them and viewing their content, thus providing more privacy.

## Permissions

`declarativeNetRequest`  
`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`  

The "`declarativeNetRequest`" and "`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`" permissions
provide the same capabilities. The differences between them is when permissions are
requested or granted.

`"declarativeNetRequest"`
Triggers a permission warning at install time but provides implicit access to
`allow`, `allowAllRequests` and `block` rules. Use this when possible to avoid
needing to request full access to hosts.
`"declarativeNetRequestFeedback"`
Enables debugging features for [unpacked extensions](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked), specifically [`getMatchedRules()`](#method-getMatchedRules) and [`onRuleMatchedDebug`](#event-onRuleMatchedDebug).
`"declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess"`
A permission warning is not shown at install time, but you must request host
permissions before you can perform any action on a host. This
is appropriate when you want to use declarative net request rules in an
extension which already has host permissions without generating additional
warnings.
## Availability

Chrome 84+

## Manifest

In addition to the permissions described previously, certain types of rulesets, static rulesets specifically, require declaring the `"declarative_net_request"` manifest key, which should be a dictionary with a single key called `"rule_resources"`. This key is an array containing dictionaries of type `Ruleset`, as shown in the following. (Note that the name 'Ruleset' does not appear in the manifest's JSON since it is merely an array.) [Static rulesets](#rules) are explained later in this document.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...

  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : [{
      "id": "ruleset_1",
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "rules_1.json"
    }, {
      "id": "ruleset_2",
      "enabled": false,
      "path": "rules_2.json"
    }]
  },
  "permissions": [
    "declarativeNetRequest",
    "declarativeNetRequestFeedback",
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://www.blogger.com/*",
    "http://*.google.com/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Rules and rulesets

To use this API, specify one or more rulesets. A ruleset contains an array of rules. A single rule does one of the following:

* Block a network request.
* Upgrade the schema (http to https).
* Prevent a request from getting blocked by negating any matching blocked rules.
* Redirect a network request.
* Modify request or response headers.

There are three types of rulesets, managed in slightly different ways.

Dynamic
Persist across browser sessions and extension upgrades and are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.
Session
Cleared when the browser shuts down and when a new version of the extension is installed. Session rules are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.
Static
Packaged, installed, and updated when an extension is installed or upgraded. Static rules are stored in JSON-formatted rule files and listed in the manifest file.
### Dynamic and session-scoped rulesets

Dynamic and session rulesets are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.

* Dynamic rules persist across browser sessions and extension upgrades.
* Session rules are cleared when the browser shuts down and when a new version of the extension is installed.

There is only one each of these ruleset types. An extension can add or remove rules to them dynamically by calling [`updateDynamicRules()`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#method-updateDynamicRules) and [`updateSessionRules()`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#method-updateSessionRules), provided the rule limits aren't exceeded. For information on rule limits, see [Rule limits](#limits). You can see [an example of this](#update-dynamic-rule-examples) under [code examples](#code-examples).

### Static rulesets

Unlike dynamic and session rules, static rules are packaged, installed, and updated when an extension is installed or upgraded. They're stored in rule files in JSON format, which are indicated to the extension using the `"declarative_net_request"` and `"rule_resources"` keys [as described above](#manifest), as well as one or more [`Ruleset`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#type-Ruleset) dictionaries. A `Ruleset` dictionary contains a path to the rule file, an ID for the ruleset contained in the file, and whether the ruleset is enabled or disabled. The last two are important when you enable or disable a ruleset programmatically.

```
{
  ...
  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : [{
      "id": "ruleset_1",
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "rules_1.json"
    },
    ...
    ]
  }
  ...
}

```

To test rule files, [load your extension unpacked](/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics#load-unpacked). Errors and warnings about invalid static rules are only displayed for unpacked extensions. Invalid static rules in packed extensions are ignored.

## Expedited review

Changes to static rulesets may be eligible for expedited review. See
[expedited review for eligible changes](/docs/webstore/expedited-review).

## Enable and disable static rules and rulesets

Both individual static rules and complete static rulesets may be enabled or disabled at runtime.

The set of enabled static rules and rulesets is persisted across browser sessions. Neither are persisted across extension updates, meaning that only rules you chose to leave in your rule files are available after an update.

For performance reasons there are also limits to the number of rules and rulesets that may be enabled at one time. Call [`getAvailableStaticRuleCount()`](#method-getAvailableStaticRuleCount) to check the number of additional rules that may be enabled. For information on rule limits, see [Rule limits](#limits).

To enable or disable static *rules*, call [`updateStaticRules()`](#method-updateStaticRules). This method takes an [`UpdateStaticRulesOptions`](#type-UpdateStaticRulesOptions) object, which contains arrays of IDs of rules to enable or disable. The IDs are defined using the `"id"` key of the `Ruleset` dictionary. There is a maximum limit of 5000 disabled static rules.

To enable or disable static *rulesets*, call [`updateEnabledRulesets()`](#method-updateEnabledRulesets). This method takes an [`UpdateRulesetOptions`](#type-UpdateRulesetOptions) object, which contains arrays of IDs of rulesets to enable or disable. The IDs are defined using the `"id"` key of the `Ruleset` dictionary.

## Build rules

Regardless of type, a rule starts with four fields as shown in the following. While the `"id"` and `"priority"` keys take a number, the [`"action"`](#property-Rule-action) and [`"condition"`](#property-Rule-condition) keys may provide several blocking and redirecting conditions. The following rule blocks all script requests originating from `"foo.com"` to any URL with `"abc"` as a substring.

```
{
  "id" : 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action" : { "type" : "block" },
  "condition" : {
    "urlFilter" : "abc",
    "initiatorDomains" : ["foo.com"],
    "resourceTypes" : ["script"]
  }
}

```
## URL matching

Declarative Net Request provides the ability to match URLs with either a pattern
matching syntax or regular expressions.

### URL filter syntax

A rule's `"condition"` key allows a `"urlFilter"` key for acting on URLs under a specified domain. You create patterns using [pattern matching tokens](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#property-RuleCondition-urlFilter). Here are a few examples.

| `urlFilter` | Matches | Does not match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"abc"` | https://abcd.comhttps://example.com/abcd | https://ab.com |
| `"abc*d"` | https://abcd.comhttps://example.com/abcxyzd | https://abc.com |
| `"||a.example.com"` | https://a.example.com/https://b.a.example.com/xyzhttps://a.example.company | https://example.com/ |
| `"|https*"` | https://example.com | http://example.com/http://https.com |
| `"example*^123|"` | https://example.com/123http://abc.com/example?123 | https://example.com/1234https://abc.com/example0123 |

### Regular expressions

Conditions can also use regular expressions. See the
[`"regexFilter"`](#property-RuleCondition-regexFilter) key. To learn about the
limits that apply to these conditions, see
[Rules that use regular expressions](#regex-rules).

### Write good URL conditions

Take care when writing rules to always match an entire domain. Otherwise, your
rule may match in situations that are unexpected. For example, when using the
pattern matching syntax:

* `google.com` incorrectly matches `https://example.com/?param=google.com`
* `||google.com` incorrectly matches `https://google.company`
* `https://www.google.com` incorrectly matches `https://example.com/?param=https://www.google.com`

Consider using:

* `||google.com/`, which matches all paths and all subdomains.
* `|https://www.google.com/` which matches all paths and no subdomains.

Similarly, use the `^` and `/` characters to anchor a regular expression. For
example, `^https:\/\/www\.google\.com\/` matches any path on
https://www.google.com.

## Rule evaluation

DNR rules are applied by the browser across various stages of the network request lifecycle.

### Before the request

Before a request is made, an extension can block or redirect (including upgrading the scheme from HTTP to HTTPS) it with a matching rule.

For each extension, the browser determines a list of matching rules. Rules with a `modifyHeaders` action are not included here as they will be handled later. Additionally, rules with a `responseHeaders` condition will be considered later (when response headers are available) and are not included.

Then, for each extension, Chrome picks at most one candidate per request. Chrome finds a matching rule, by ordering all matching rules by priority. Rules with the same priority are ordered by action (`allow` or `allowAllRequests` > `block` > `upgradeScheme` > `redirect`).

If the candidate is an `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rule, or the frame the request is being made in previously matched an `allowAllRequests` rule of higher or equal priority from this extension, the request is "allowed" and the extension won't have any effect on the request.

If more than one extension wants to block or redirect this request, a single action to take is chosen. Chrome does this by sorting the rules in the order `block` > `redirect` or `upgradeScheme` > `allow` or `allowAllRequests`. If two rules are of the same type, Chrome chooses the rule from the most recently installed extension.

### Before request headers are sent

Before Chrome sends request headers to the server, the headers are updated based on matching `modifyHeaders` rules.

Within a single extension, Chrome builds the list of modifications to perform by finding all matching `modifyHeaders` rules. Similar to before, only rules which have a higher priority than any matching `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rules are included.

These rules are applied by Chrome in an order such that rules from a more recently installed extension are always evaluated before rules from an older extension. Additionally, rules of a higher priority from one extension are always applied before rules of a lower priority from the same extension. Notably, even across extensions:

* If a rule appends to a header, then lower priority rules can only append to that header. Set and remove operations are not allowed.
* If a rule sets a header, then only lower priority rules from the same extension can append to that header. No other modifications are allowed.
* If a rule removes a header, then lower priority rules cannot further modify the header.

### Once a response is received

Once the response headers have been received, Chrome evaluates rules with a `responseHeaders` condition.

After sorting these rules by `action` and `priority` and excluding any rules made redundant by a matching `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rule (this happens identically to the steps in "Before the request"), Chrome may block or redirect the request on behalf of an extension.

Note that if a request made it to this stage, the request has already been sent to the server and the server has received data like the request body. A block or redirect rule with a response headers condition will still run–but cannot actually block or redirect the request.

In the case of a block rule, this is handled by the page which made the request receiving a blocked response and Chrome terminating the request early. In the case of a redirect rule, Chrome makes a new request to the redirected URL. Make sure to consider if these behaviors meet the privacy expectations for your extension.

If the request is not blocked or redirected, Chrome applies any `modifyHeaders` rules. Applying modifications to response headers works in the same way as described in "Before request headers are sent". Applying modifications to request headers does nothing, since the request has already been made.

## Safe rules

Safe rules are defined as rules with an action of `block`, `allow`,
`allowAllRequests` or `upgradeScheme`. These rules are subject to an increased
dynamic rules [quota](#dynamic-rules).

## Rule limits

There is a performance overhead to loading and evaluating rules in the browser,
so some limits apply when using the API. Limits depend on the type of
rule you're using.

### Static rules

Static rules are those specified in rule files declared in the manifest file. An extension can specify up to 100 static [rulesets](#type-Ruleset) as part of the `"rule_resources"` manifest key, but only 50 of these rulesets can be enabled at a time. The latter is called the [`MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS). Collectively, those rulesets are guaranteed at least 30,000 rules. This is called the [`GUARANTEED_MINIMUM_STATIC_RULES`](#property-GUARANTEED_MINIMUM_STATIC_RULES).

The number of rules available after that depends on how many rules are enabled by all the extensions installed on a user's browser. You can find this number at runtime by calling [`getAvailableStaticRuleCount()`](#method-getAvailableStaticRuleCount). You can see [an example of this](#update-static-rulesets) under [code examples](#code-examples).

### Session rules

An extension can have up to 5000 session rules. This is exposed as the
[`MAX_NUMBER_OF_SESSION_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_SESSION_RULES).

Before Chrome 120, there was a limit of 5000 combined dynamic and session rules.

### Dynamic rules

An extension can have at least 5000 dynamic rules. This is exposed as the
[`MAX_NUMBER_OF_UNSAFE_DYNAMIC_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_UNSAFE_DYNAMIC_RULES).

Starting in Chrome 121, there is a larger limit of 30,000 rules available for [safe](#safe_rules) dynamic rules,
exposed as the [`MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES). Any
unsafe rules added within the limit of 5000 will also count towards this limit.

Before Chrome 120, there was a 5000 combined dynamic and session rules limit.

### Rules that use regular expressions

All types of rules can use regular expressions; however, the total number of regular expression rules of each type cannot exceed 1000. This is called the [MAX\_NUMBER\_OF\_REGEX\_RULES](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_REGEX_RULES).

Additionally, each rule must be less than 2KB once compiled. This roughly correlates with the complexity of the rule. If you try to load a rule that exceeds this limit, you will see a warning like the following and the rule will be ignored.

```
rules_1.json: Rule with id 1 specified a more complex regex than allowed
as part of the "regexFilter" key.

```
## Interactions with service workers

A declarativeNetRequest only applies to requests that reach the network stack. This includes responses from the HTTP cache, but may not include responses that go through a service worker's `onfetch` handler. declarativeNetRequest won't affect responses generated by the service worker or retrieved from `CacheStorage`, but it will affect calls to `fetch()` made in a service worker.

## Web accessible resources

A declarativeNetRequest rule cannot redirect from a public resource request to a resource that is not web accessible. Doing so triggers an error. This is true even if the specified web accessible resource is owned by the redirecting extension. To declare resources for declarativeNetRequest, use the manifest's [`"web_accessible_resources"`](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) array.

## Header modification

The append operation is only supported for the following headers: `accept`, `accept-encoding`, `accept-language`, `access-control-request-headers`, `cache-control`, `connection`, `content-language`, `cookie`, `forwarded`, `if-match`, `if-none-match`, `keep-alive`, `range`, `te`, `trailer`, `transfer-encoding`, `upgrade`, `user-agent`, `via`, `want-digest`, `x-forwarded-for`.

## Examples

### Code examples

#### Update dynamic rules

The following example shows how to call `updateDynamicRules()`. The procedure for `updateSessionRules()` is the same.

```
// Get arrays containing new and old rules
const newRules = await getNewRules();
const oldRules = await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getDynamicRules();
const oldRuleIds = oldRules.map(rule => rule.id);

// Use the arrays to update the dynamic rules
await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules({
  removeRuleIds: oldRuleIds,
  addRules: newRules
});

```
#### Update static rulesets

The following example shows how to enable and disable rulesets while considering the number of available and the maximum number of enabled static rulesets. You would do this when the number of static rules you need exceeds the number allowed. For this to work, some of your rulesets should be installed with some of your rulesets disabled (setting `"Enabled"` to `false` within the manifest file).

```
async function updateStaticRules(enableRulesetIds, disableCandidateIds) {
  // Create the options structure for the call to updateEnabledRulesets()
  let options = { enableRulesetIds: enableRulesetIds }
  // Get the number of enabled static rules
  const enabledStaticCount = await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getEnabledRulesets();
  // Compare rule counts to determine if anything needs to be disabled so that
  // new rules can be enabled
  const proposedCount = enableRulesetIds.length;
  if (enabledStaticCount + proposedCount > chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS) {
    options.disableRulesetIds = disableCandidateIds
  }
  // Update the enabled static rules
  await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateEnabledRulesets(options);
}

```
### Rule examples

The following examples illustrate how Chrome prioritizes rules in an extension. When reviewing them, you may want to open the [prioritization](#implementation-matching-algorithm) rules in a separate window.

#### The "priority" key

These examples require [host permission](/docs/extensions/mv3/declare_permissions) to `*://*.example.com/*`.

To work out the priority of a particular URL, look at the (developer-defined) `"priority"` key, the `"action"` key and the `"urlFilter"` key. These examples refer to the example rule file shown below them.

Navigation to https://google.com
Two rules cover this URL: the rules with IDs 1 and 4. The rule with ID 1 applies because `"block"` actions have a higher priority than `"redirect"` actions. The remaining rules don't apply because they are for longer URLs.
Navigation to https://google.com/1234
Because of the longer URL, the rule with ID 2 now matches in addition to the rules with IDs 1 and 4. The rule with ID 2 applies because `"allow"` has a higher priority than `"block"` and `"redirect"`.
Navigation to https://google.com/12345
All four rules match this URL. The rule with ID 3 applies because its developer-defined priority is the highest of the group.

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "block" },
    "condition": {"urlFilter": "||google.com/", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "allow" },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/123", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "priority": 2,
    "action": { "type": "block" },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/12345", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "redirect", "redirect": { "url": "https://example.com" } },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
]

```
#### Redirects

The example below requires [host permission](/docs/extensions/mv3/declare_permissions) to `*://*.example.com/*`.

The following example shows how to redirect a request from example.com to a page within the extension itself. The extension path `/a.jpg` resolves to `chrome-extension://EXTENSION_ID/a.jpg`, where `EXTENSION_ID` is the ID of your extension. For this to work the manifest should declare `/a.jpg` as a [web accessible resource](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources).

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": { "type": "redirect", "redirect": { "extensionPath": "/a.jpg" } },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||https://www.example.com/",
    "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"]
  }
}

```

The following uses the `"transform"` key to redirect to a subdomain of example.com. It uses a domain name anchor ("||") to intercept requests with any scheme from example.com. The `"scheme"` key in `"transform"` specifies that redirects to the subdomain will always use "https".

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "redirect",
    "redirect": {
      "transform": { "scheme": "https", "host": "new.example.com" }
    }
  },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||example.com/",
    "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"]
  }
}

```

The following example uses regular expressions to redirect from `https://www.abc.xyz.com/path` to `https://abc.xyz.com/path`. In the `"regexFilter"` key, notice how periods are escaped and that the capturing group selects either "abc" or "def". The `"regexSubstitution"` key specifies the first returned match of the regular expression using "\1". In this case, "abc" is captured from the redirected URL and placed in the substitution.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "redirect",
    "redirect": {
      "regexSubstitution": "https://\\1.xyz.com/"
    }
  },
  "condition": {
    "regexFilter": "^https://www\\.(abc|def)\\.xyz\\.com/",
    "resourceTypes": [
      "main_frame"
    ]
  }
}

```
#### Headers

The following example removes all cookies from both a main frame and any sub frames.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "modifyHeaders",
    "requestHeaders": [{ "header": "cookie", "operation": "remove" }]
  },
  "condition": { "resourceTypes": ["main_frame", "sub_frame"] }
}

```
## Types

### DomainType

This describes whether the request is first or third party to the frame in which it originated. A request is said to be first party if it has the same domain (eTLD+1) as the frame in which the request originated.

#### Enum

"firstParty"   
 The network request is first party to the frame in which it originated.

"thirdParty"   
 The network request is third party to the frame in which it originated.

### ExtensionActionOptions

Only supported for session-scoped rules.
* initiatorDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will only match network requests originating from the list of `initiatorDomains`. If the list is omitted, the rule is applied to requests from all domains. An empty list is not allowed.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + This matches against the request initiator and not the request url.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also matched.
* isUrlFilterCaseSensitive

  boolean optional

  Whether the `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` (whichever is specified) is case sensitive. Default is false.

* requestDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will only match network requests when the domain matches one from the list of `requestDomains`. If the list is omitted, the rule is applied to requests from all domains. An empty list is not allowed.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also matched.
* requestMethods

  [RequestMethod](#type-RequestMethod)[] optional

  Chrome 91+

* tabIds

  number[] optional

  Chrome 92+

  List of [`tabs.Tab.id`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-Tab-id) which the rule should match. An ID of [`tabs.TAB_ID_NONE`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-TAB_ID_NONE) matches requests which don't originate from a tab. An empty list is not allowed. Only supported for session-scoped rules.
* urlFilter

  string optional

  The pattern which is matched against the network request url. Supported constructs:

  **'\*'** : Wildcard: Matches any number of characters.

  **'|'** : Left/right anchor: If used at either end of the pattern, specifies the beginning/end of the url respectively.

  **'||'** : Domain name anchor: If used at the beginning of the pattern, specifies the start of a (sub-)domain of the URL.

  **'^'** : Separator character: This matches anything except a letter, a digit, or one of the following: `_`, `-`, `.`, or `%`. This also match the end of the URL.

  Therefore `urlFilter` is composed of the following parts: (optional Left/Domain name anchor) + pattern + (optional Right anchor).

  If omitted, all urls are matched. An empty string is not allowed.

  A pattern beginning with `||*` is not allowed. Use `*` instead.

  Note: Only one of `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` can be specified.

  Note: The `urlFilter` must be composed of only ASCII characters. This is matched against a url where the host is encoded in the punycode format (in case of internationalized domains) and any other non-ascii characters are url encoded in utf-8. For example, when the request url is http://abc.рф?q=ф, the `urlFilter` will be matched against the url http://abc.xn--p1ai/?q=%D1%84.

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/inspectedWindow

# chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow` API to interact with the inspected window: obtain the tab ID for the inspected page, evaluate the code in the context of the inspected window, reload the page, or obtain the list of resources within the page.

See [DevTools APIs summary](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) for general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.

The [`tabId`](#property-tabId) property provides the tab identifier that you can use with the [`chrome.tabs.*`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs)
API calls. However, please note that `chrome.tabs.*` API is not exposed to the Developer Tools
extension pages due to security considerations—you will need to pass the tab ID to the background
page and invoke the `chrome.tabs.*` API functions from there.

The `reload` method may be used to reload the inspected page. Additionally, the caller can specify
an override for the user agent string, a script that will be injected early upon page load, or an
option to force reload of cached resources.

Use the `getResources` call and the `onResourceContent` event to obtain the list of resources
(documents, stylesheets, scripts, images etc) within the inspected page. The `getContent` and
`setContent` methods of the `Resource` class along with the `onResourceContentCommitted` event may
be used to support modification of the resource content, for example, by an external editor.

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"devtools_page"`  
## Execute code in the inspected window

The `eval` method provides the ability for extensions to execute JavaScript code in the context of
the inspected page. This method is powerful when used in the right context and dangerous when used
inappropriately. Use the [`tabs.executeScript`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#method-executeScript) method unless you need the specific functionality
that the `eval` method provides.

Here are the main differences between the `eval` and `tabs.executeScript` methods:

* The `eval` method does not use an isolated world for the code being evaluated, so the JavaScript
  state of the inspected window is accessible to the code. Use this method when access to the
  JavaScript state of the inspected page is required.
* The execution context of the code being evaluated includes the [Developer Tools console API](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
  For example, the code can use `inspect` and `$0`.
* The evaluated code may return a value that is passed to the extension callback. The returned value
  has to be a valid JSON object (it may contain only primitive JavaScript types and acyclic
  references to other JSON objects). *Please observe extra care while processing the data received
  from the inspected page—the execution context is essentially controlled by the inspected page; a
  malicious page may affect the data being returned to the extension.*

Note that a page can include multiple different JavaScript execution contexts. Each frame has its
own context, plus an additional context for each extension that has content scripts running in that
frame.

By default, the `eval` method executes in the context of the main frame of the inspected page.

The `eval` method takes an optional second argument that you can use to specify the context in which
the code is evaluated. This *options* object can contain one or more of the following keys:

`frameURL`
Use to specify a frame other than the inspected page's main frame.
`contextSecurityOrigin`
Use to select a context within the specified frame according to its [web origin](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6454.txt).
`useContentScriptContext`
If true, execute the script in the same context as the extensions's content scripts. (Equivalent to
specifying the extensions's own web orgin as the context security origin.) This can be used to
exchange data with the content script.
## Examples

The following code checks for the version of jQuery used by the inspected page:

```
chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval(
  "jQuery.fn.jquery",
  function(result, isException) {
    if (isException) {
      console.log("the page is not using jQuery");
    } else {
      console.log("The page is using jQuery v" + result);
    }
  }
);

```

## Methods

### eval()

```
chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval(  
  expression: string,  
  options?: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Evaluates a JavaScript expression in the context of the main frame of the inspected page. The expression must evaluate to a JSON-compliant object, otherwise an exception is thrown. The eval function can report either a DevTools-side error or a JavaScript exception that occurs during evaluation. In either case, the `result` parameter of the callback is `undefined`. In the case of a DevTools-side error, the `isException` parameter is non-null and has `isError` set to true and `code` set to an error code. In the case of a JavaScript error, `isException` is set to true and `value` is set to the string value of thrown object.

#### Parameters

* expression

  string

  An expression to evaluate.
* options

  object optional

  The options parameter can contain one or more options.

  + frameURL

    string optional

    If specified, the expression is evaluated on the iframe whose URL matches the one specified. By default, the expression is evaluated in the top frame of the inspected page.
  + scriptExecutionContext

    string optional

    Chrome 107+

    Evaluate the expression in the context of a content script of an extension that matches the specified origin. If given, scriptExecutionContext overrides the 'true' setting on useContentScriptContext.
  + useContentScriptContext

    boolean optional

    Evaluate the expression in the context of the content script of the calling extension, provided that the content script is already injected into the inspected page. If not, the expression is not evaluated and the callback is invoked with the exception parameter set to an object that has the `isError` field set to true and the `code` field set to `E_NOTFOUND`.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: object, exceptionInfo: object) => void

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/network

# chrome.devtools.network

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.devtools.network` API to retrieve the information about network requests displayed by the Developer Tools in the Network panel.

Network requests information is represented in the HTTP Archive format (*HAR*). The description of
HAR is outside of scope of this document, refer to [HAR v1.2 Specification](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/).

In terms of HAR, the `chrome.devtools.network.getHAR()` method returns entire *HAR log*, while
`chrome.devtools.network.onRequestFinished` event provides *HAR entry* as an argument to the event
callback.

Note that request content is not provided as part of HAR for efficiency reasons. You may call
request's `getContent()` method to retrieve content.

If the Developer Tools window is opened after the page is loaded, some requests may be missing in
the array of entries returned by `getHAR()`. Reload the page to get all requests. In general, the
list of requests returned by `getHAR()` should match that displayed in the Network panel.

See [DevTools APIs summary](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) for general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"devtools_page"`  
## Examples

The following code logs URLs of all images larger than 40KB as they are loaded:

```
chrome.devtools.network.onRequestFinished.addListener(
  function(request) {
    if (request.response.bodySize > 40*1024) {
      chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval(
          'console.log("Large image: " + unescape("' +
          escape(request.request.url) + '"))');
    }
  }
);

```

To try this API, install the [devtools API examples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/devtools) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

# chrome.devtools.panels

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.devtools.panels` API to integrate your extension into Developer Tools window UI: create your own panels, access existing panels, and add sidebars.

Each extension panel and sidebar is displayed as a separate HTML page. All extension pages displayed
in the Developer Tools window have access to all parts of the `chrome.devtools` API, as well as all
other extension APIs.

You can use the [`devtools.panels.setOpenResourceHandler`](#method-setOpenResourceHandler) method to install a callback function
that handles user requests to open a resource (typically, a click a resource link in the
Developer Tools window). At most one of the installed handlers gets called; users can specify (using
the Developer Tools Settings dialog) either the default behavior or an extension to handle resource
open requests. If an extension calls `setOpenResourceHandler()` multiple times, only the last
handler is retained.

See [DevTools APIs summary](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) for general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"devtools_page"`  
## Example

The following code adds a panel contained in `Panel.html`, represented by `FontPicker.png` on the
Developer Tools toolbar and labeled as *Font Picker*:

```
chrome.devtools.panels.create("Font Picker",
                              "FontPicker.png",
                              "Panel.html",
                              function(panel) { ... });

```

The following code adds a sidebar pane contained in `Sidebar.html` and titled *Font Properties* to
the Elements panel, then sets its height to `8ex`:

```
chrome.devtools.panels.elements.createSidebarPane("Font Properties",
  function(sidebar) {
    sidebar.setPage("Sidebar.html");
    sidebar.setHeight("8ex");
  }
);

```

The screenshot illustrates the effect this example would have on Developer Tools window:

To try this API, install the [devtools panels API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/devtools/panels) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/performance

# chrome.devtools.performance

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.devtools.performance` API to listen to recording status updates in the Performance panel in DevTools.

See [DevTools APIs summary](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) for general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.

## Availability

Chrome 129+

## Concepts and usage

The chrome.devtools.performance API allows developers to interact with the recording features of the **[Performance panel](/docs/devtools/performance)** panel in Chrome DevTools. You can use this API to get notifications when recording starts or stops.

Two events are available:

* [onProfilingStarted](#event-onProfilingStarted): This event is fired when the **Performance** panel begins recording performance data.
* [onProfilingStopped](#event-onProfilingStopped): This event is fired when the **Performance** panel stops recording performance data.
  stance that associates the current stack trace with the cre
  Both events don't have any associated parameters.

By listening to these events, developers can create extensions that react to the recording status in the **Performance** panel, providing additional automation during performance profiling.

## Examples

This is how you can use the API to listen to recording status updates

```

chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStarted.addListener(() => {
  // Profiling started listener implementation
});

chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStopped.addListener(() => {
  // Profiling stopped listener implementation
})

```
## Events

### onProfilingStarted

```
chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStarted.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when the Performance panel starts recording.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onProfilingStopped

```
chrome.devtools.performance.onProfilingStopped.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when the Performance panel stops recording.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```

# chrome.devtools.recorder  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/devtools/recorder

# chrome.devtools.recorder

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.devtools.recorder` API to customize the Recorder panel in DevTools.

`devtools.recorder` API is a preview feature that allows you to extend the [Recorder panel](/docs/devtools/recorder) in Chrome DevTools.

See [DevTools APIs summary](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) for general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.

## Availability

Chrome 105+

## Concepts and usage

### Customizing the export feature

To register an extension plugin, use the `registerRecorderExtensionPlugin` function. This function requires a plugin instance, a `name` and a `mediaType` as parameters. The plugin instance must implement two methods: `stringify` and `stringifyStep`.

The `name` provided by the extension shows up in the **Export** menu in the **Recorder** panel.

Depending on the export context, when the user clicks the export option provided by the extension,
the **Recorder** panel invokes one of the two functions:

* `stringify` that receives an [entire user flow recording](https://github.com/puppeteer/replay/blob/main/src/Schema.ts#L245)
* `stringifyStep` that receives a [single recorded step](https://github.com/puppeteer/replay/blob/main/src/Schema.ts#L243)

The [`mediaType`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) parameter allows the extension to specify the kind of output it generates with the
`stringify` and `stringifyStep` functions. For example, `application/javascript` if the result is a JavaScript
program.

### Customizing the replay button

To customize the replay button in the **Recorder**, use the `registerRecorderExtensionPlugin` function. The plugin must implement the `replay` method for the customization to take effect.
If the method is detected, a replay button will appear in the **Recorder**.
Upon clicking the button, the current recording object will be passed as the first argument to the `replay` method.

At this point, the extension can display a `RecorderView` for handling the replay or use other extension APIs to process the replay request. To create a new `RecorderView`, invoke `chrome.devtools.recorder.createView`.

## Examples

### Export plugin

The following code implements an extension plugin that stringifes a recording using `JSON.stringify`:

```
class MyPlugin {
  stringify(recording) {
    return Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(recording));
  }
  stringifyStep(step) {
    return Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(step));
  }
}

chrome.devtools.recorder.registerRecorderExtensionPlugin(
  new MyPlugin(),
  /*name=*/'MyPlugin',
  /*mediaType=*/'application/json'
);

```
### Replay plugin

The following code implements an extension plugin that creates a dummy Recorder view and displays it upon a replay request:

```
const view = await chrome.devtools.recorder.createView(
  /* name= */ 'ExtensionName',
  /* pagePath= */ 'Replay.html'
);

let latestRecording;

view.onShown.addListener(() => {
  // Recorder has shown the view. Send additional data to the view if needed.
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage(JSON.stringify(latestRecording));
});

view.onHidden.addListener(() => {
  // Recorder has hidden the view.
});

export class RecorderPlugin {
  replay(recording) {
    // Share the data with the view.
    latestRecording = recording;
    // Request to show the view.
    view.show();
  }
}

chrome.devtools.recorder.registerRecorderExtensionPlugin(
  new RecorderPlugin(),
  /* name=*/ 'CoffeeTest'
);

```

* resultCode

  number

  The result code. Zero indicates success.
## Methods

### resolve()

Promise

```
chrome.dns.resolve(  
  hostname: string,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Resolves the given hostname or IP address literal.

#### Parameters

* hostname

  string

  The hostname to resolve.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (resolveInfo: [ResolveCallbackResolveInfo](#type-ResolveCallbackResolveInfo)) => void
  ```

  + resolveInfo

    [ResolveCallbackResolveInfo](#type-ResolveCallbackResolveInfo)
#### Returns

# chrome.documentScan

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.documentScan` API to discover and retrieve images from attached document scanners.

The Document Scan API is designed to allow apps and extensions to view the
content of paper documents on an attached document scanner.

## Permissions

`documentScan`  
## Availability

Chrome 44+
ChromeOS only

Availability for API members added later is shown with those members.
## Concepts and usage

This API supports two means of scanning documents. If your use case can work
with any scanner and doesn't require control of the configuration, use the
`scan()` method. More complicated use cases require a combination of methods,
which are only supported in Chrome 124 and later.

### Simple scanning

For simple use cases, meaning those that can work with any scanner and don't
require control of configuration, call `scan()`. This method takes a
`ScanOptions` object and returns a Promise that resolves with a `ScanResults`
object. The capabilities of this option are limited to the number of scans and
the MIME types that will be accepted by the caller. Scans are returned as URLs
for display in an `<img>` tag for a user interface.

### Complex scanning

Complex scans are accomplished in three phases as described in this section.
This outline does not describe every method argument or every property returned
in a response. It is only intended to give you a general guide to writing scanner
code.

#### Discovery

1. Call [`getScannerList()`](#method-getscannerlist). Available scanners are
   returned in a Promise that resolves with a
   [`GetScannerListResponse`](#type-getscannerlistresponse).

   * The response object contains an array of [`ScannerInfo`](#type-scannerinfo)
     objects.
   * The array may contain multiple entries for a single scanner if that scanner
     supports multiple protocols or connection methods.
2. Select a scanner from the returned array and save the value of its
   `scannerId` property.

   Use the properties of individual `ScannerInfo` objects
   to distinguish among multiple objects for the same scanner. Objects from the
   same scanner will have the same value for the `deviceUuid` property.
   `ScannerInfo` also contains an `imageFormats` property containing an array of
   supported image types.

#### Scanner configuration

1. Call [`openScanner()`](#method-openscanner), passing in the saved scanner ID.
   It returns a Promise that resolves with an [`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse).
   The response object contains:

   * A `scannerHandle` property, which you'll need to save.
   * An options property containing scanner-specific properties, which you'll
     need to set. See Retrieve scanner options for more information.
2. (Optional) If you need the user to provide values for scanner options,
   construct a user interface. You will need the scanner options provided by the
   previous step, and you'll need to retrieve option groups provided by the
   scanner. See [Construct a user interface](/docs/extensions/develop/ui) for more information.
3. Construct an array of [`OptionSetting`](#type-optionsetting) objects using
   programmatic or user-provided values. See Set scanner options for more
   information.
4. Pass the array of `OptionSetting` objects to
   [`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions) to set options for the scanner. It
   returns a Promise that resolves with a
   [`SetOptionsResponse`](#type-setoptionsresponse). This object contains an
   updated version of the scanner options retrieved in step 1 of scanner
   configuration.

   Since changing one
   option can alter constraints on another option, you may need to repeat these
   steps several times.

#### Scanning

1. Construct a [`StartScanOptions`](#type-startscanoptions) object and pass it
   to [`startScan()`](#method-startscan). It returns a Promise that resolves
   with a [`StartScanResponse`](#type-startscanresponse). Its `job` property is
   a handle that you will use to either read scan data or cancel the scan.
2. Pass the job handle to [`readScanData()`](#method-readscandata). It returns a
   Promise that resolves with a
   [`ReadScanDataResponse`](#type-readscandataresponse) object. If data was read
   successfully, its `result` property equals `SUCCESS` and its `data` property
   contains an
   [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer)
   with part of the scan. Note that `estimatedCompletion` contains an estimated
   percentage of the total data that has been delivered so far.
3. Repeat the previous step until the `result` property equals `EOF` or an error.

When the end of the scan is reached, call
[`closeScanner()`](#method-closescanner) with the scanner handle saved in step
3. It returns a Promise that resolves with a
[`CloseScannerResponse`](#type-closescannerresponse). Calling
[`cancelScan()`](#method-cancelscan) at any time after the job is created will
end scanning.

### Response objects

All methods return a Promise that resolves with a response object of some kind.
Most of these contain a `result` property whose value is a member of
[`OperationResult`](#type-operationresult). Some properties of response objects
won't contain values unless the value of `result` has a specific value. These
relationships are described in the reference for each response object.

For example, `OpenScannerResponse.scannerHandle` will only have a value when
`OpenScannerResponse.result` equals `SUCCESS`.

### Scanner options

Scanner options vary considerably by device. Consequently, it's not possible to
reflect scanner options directly within the documentScan API. To get around
this, the [`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse) (retrieved using
[`openScanner()`](#method-openscanner)) and the
[`SetOptionsResponse`](#type-setoptionsresponse) (the response object for
[`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions)) contain an `options` property which is an
object containing scanner-specific options. Each option is a key-value mapping
where the key is a device-specific option and the value is an instance of
[`ScannerOption`](#type-scanneroption).

The structure generally looks like this:

```
{
  "key1": { scannerOptionInstance }
  "key2": { scannerOptionInstance }
}

```

For example, imagine a scanner that returns options named "source" and
"resolution". The structure of the returned `options` object will look something
like the following example. For simplicity, only partial `ScannerOption`
responses are shown.

```
{
  "source": {
    "name": "source",
    "type": OptionType.STRING,
...
},
  "resolution": {
    "name": "resolution",
    "type": OptionType.INT,
...
  },
...
}

```
### Construct a user interface

Though not required to use this API, you may want a user to choose the value for
a particular option. This requires a user interface. Use the
[`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse) (opened by
[`openScanner()`](#type-openscanner)) to retrieve the options for the attached
scanner as described in the previous section.

Some scanners group options in device-specific ways. They don't affect option
behaviors, but since these groups may be mentioned in a scanner's product
documentation, such groups should be shown to the user. You can retrieve these
groups by calling [`getOptionGroups()`](#method-getoptionsgroup). This returns a
Promise that resolves with a
[`GetOptionGroupsResponse`](#type-getoptiongroupsreponse) object. Its `groups`
property contains a scanner-specific array of groups. Use the information in
these groups to organize the options in the
[`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse) for display.

```
{
  scannerHandle: "123456",
  result: SUCCESS,
  groups: [
    {
      title: "Standard",
      members: [ "resolution", "mode", "source" ]
    }
  ]
}

```

As stated under Scanner configuration, changing one option can alter constraints
on another option. This is why
[`setOptionsResponse`](#method-setoptionsresponse) (the response object for
[`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions)) contains another `options` property. Use
this to update the user interface. Then repeat as needed until all options are
set.

### Set scanner options

Set scanner options by passing an array of
[`OptionSetting`](#type-optionsetting) objects to
[`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions). For an example, see the following [Scan one letter-size page](#scan_one_letter-size_page) section.

## Examples

### Retrieve a page as a blob

This example shows one way to retrieve a page from the scanner as a blob and
demonstrates use of `startScan()` and `readScanData()` using the value of
`OperationResult`.

```
async function pageAsBlob(handle) {
  let response = await chrome.documentScan.startScan(
      handle, {format: "image/jpeg"});
  if (response.result != chrome.documentScan.OperationResult.SUCCESS) {
    return null;
  }
  const job = response.job;

  let imgParts = [];
  response = await chrome.documentScan.readScanData(job);
  while (response.result == chrome.documentScan.OperationResult.SUCCESS) {
    if (response.data && response.data.byteLength > 0) {
        imgParts.push(response.data);
    } else {
      // Delay so hardware can make progress.
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100));
    }
    response = await chrome.documentScan.readScanData(job);
  }
  if (response.result != chrome.documentScan.OperationResult.EOF) {
    return null;
  }
  if (response.data && response.data.byteLength > 0) {
    imgParts.push(response.data);
  }
  return new Blob(imgParts, { type: "image/jpeg" });
}

```
### Scan one letter-size page

This example shows how to select a scanner, set its options, and open it. It
then retrieves the contents of a single page and closes the scanner. This process
demonstrates using `getScannerList()`, `openScanner()`, `setOptions()`, and
`closeScanner()`. Note that the contents of the page are retrieved by calling
the `pageAsBlob()` function from the previous example.

```
async function scan() {
    let response = await chrome.documentScan.getScannerList({ secure: true });
    let scanner = await chrome.documentScan.openScanner(
        response.scanners[0].scannerId);
    const handle = scanner.scannerHandle;

    let options = [];
    for (source of scanner.options["source"].constraint.list) {
        if (source.includes("ADF")) {
            options.push({
                name: "source",
                type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.STRING,
                value: { value: source }
            });
            break;
        }
    }
    options.push({
        name: "tl-x",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 0.0
    });
    options.push({
        name: "br-x",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 215.9  // 8.5" in mm
    });
    options.push({
        name: "tl-y",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 0.0
    });
    options.push({
        name: "br-y",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 279.4  // 11" in mm
    });
    response = await chrome.documentScan.setOptions(handle, options);

    let imgBlob = await pageAsBlob(handle);
    if (imgBlob != null) {
        // Insert imgBlob into DOM, save to disk, etc
    }
    await chrome.documentScan.closeScanner(handle);
}

```
### Show the configuration

As stated elsewhere, showing a scanner's configuration options to a user requires
calling `getOptionGroups()` in addition to the scanner options returned from a
call to `openScanner()`. This is so that options can be shown to users in
manufacturer-defined groups. This example shows how to do that.

```
async function showConfig() {
  let response = await chrome.documentScan.getScannerList({ secure: true });
  let scanner = await chrome.documentScan.openScanner(
      response.scanners[0].scannerId);
  let groups = await chrome.documentScan.getOptionGroups(scanner.scannerHandle);

  for (const group of groups.groups) {
    console.log("=== " + group.title + " ===");
    for (const member of group.members) {
      const option = scanner.options[member];
      if (option.isActive) {
        console.log("  " + option.name + " = " + option.value);
      } else {
        console.log("  " + option.name + " is inactive");
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Methods

### acceptDanger()

Promise

```
chrome.downloads.acceptDanger(  
  downloadId: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Prompt the user to accept a dangerous download. Can only be called from a visible context (tab, window, or page/browser action popup). Does not automatically accept dangerous downloads. If the download is accepted, then an [`onChanged`](#event-onChanged) event will fire, otherwise nothing will happen. When all the data is fetched into a temporary file and either the download is not dangerous or the danger has been accepted, then the temporary file is renamed to the target filename, the `state` changes to 'complete', and [`onChanged`](#event-onChanged) fires.

#### Parameters

* downloadId

  number

  The identifier for the [`DownloadItem`](#type-DownloadItem).
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### cancel()

Promise

```
chrome.downloads.cancel(  
  downloadId: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Cancel a download. When `callback` is run, the download is cancelled, completed, interrupted or doesn't exist anymore.

#### Parameters

* downloadId

  number

  The id of the download to cancel.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```

### download()

Promise

```
chrome.downloads.download(  
  options: [DownloadOptions](#type-DownloadOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Download a URL. If the URL uses the HTTP[S] protocol, then the request will include all cookies currently set for its hostname. If both `filename` and `saveAs` are specified, then the Save As dialog will be displayed, pre-populated with the specified `filename`. If the download started successfully, `callback` will be called with the new [`DownloadItem`](#type-DownloadItem)'s `downloadId`. If there was an error starting the download, then `callback` will be called with `downloadId=undefined` and [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) will contain a descriptive string. The error strings are not guaranteed to remain backwards compatible between releases. Extensions must not parse it.

#### Parameters

* options

  [DownloadOptions](#type-DownloadOptions)

  What to download and how.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (downloadId: number) => void
  ```

  + downloadId

    number
#### Returns

* Promise<number>

  Chrome 96+

chrome.downloads.erase(  
  query: [DownloadQuery](#type-DownloadQuery),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Erase matching [`DownloadItem`](#type-DownloadItem) from history without deleting the downloaded file. An [`onErased`](#event-onErased) event will fire for each [`DownloadItem`](#type-DownloadItem) that matches `query`, then `callback` will be called.

#### Parameters

* query

  [DownloadQuery](#type-DownloadQuery)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (erasedIds: number[]) => void
  ```

```
chrome.downloads.getFileIcon(  
  downloadId: number,  
  options?: [GetFileIconOptions](#type-GetFileIconOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Retrieve an icon for the specified download. For new downloads, file icons are available after the [`onCreated`](#event-onCreated) event has been received. The image returned by this function while a download is in progress may be different from the image returned after the download is complete. Icon retrieval is done by querying the underlying operating system or toolkit depending on the platform. The icon that is returned will therefore depend on a number of factors including state of the download, platform, registered file types and visual theme. If a file icon cannot be determined, [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) will contain an error message.

  number

  The identifier for the downloaded file.
### showDefaultFolder()

```
chrome.downloads.showDefaultFolder()
```

Show the default Downloads folder in a file manager.

## Events

### onChanged

```
chrome.downloads.onChanged.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

When any of a [`DownloadItem`](#type-DownloadItem)'s properties except `bytesReceived` and `estimatedEndTime` changes, this event fires with the `downloadId` and an object containing the properties that changed.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (downloadDelta: [DownloadDelta](#type-DownloadDelta)) => void
  ```

  + downloadDelta

    [DownloadDelta](#type-DownloadDelta)
### onCreated

```
chrome.downloads.onCreated.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

This event fires with the [`DownloadItem`](#type-DownloadItem) object when a download begins.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (downloadItem: [DownloadItem](#type-DownloadItem)) => void
  ```

  + downloadItem

    [DownloadItem](#type-DownloadItem)
### onDeterminingFilename

```
chrome.downloads.onDeterminingFilename.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

During the filename determination process, extensions will be given the opportunity to override the target [`DownloadItem.filename`](#property-DownloadItem-filename). Each extension may not register more than one listener for this event. Each listener must call `suggest` exactly once, either synchronously or asynchronously. If the listener calls `suggest` asynchronously, then it must return `true`. If the listener neither calls `suggest` synchronously nor returns `true`, then `suggest` will be called automatically. The [`DownloadItem`](#type-DownloadItem) will not complete until all listeners have called `suggest`. Listeners may call `suggest` without any arguments in order to allow the download to use `downloadItem.filename` for its filename, or pass a `suggestion` object to `suggest` in order to override the target filename. If more than one extension overrides the filename, then the last extension installed whose listener passes a `suggestion` object to `suggest` wins. In order to avoid confusion regarding which extension will win, users should not install extensions that may conflict. If the download is initiated by [`download`](#method-download) and the target filename is known before the MIME type and tentative filename have been determined, pass `filename` to [`download`](#method-download) instead.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (downloadItem: [DownloadItem](#type-DownloadItem), suggest: function) => void
  ```

  + downloadItem

    [DownloadItem](#type-DownloadItem)
  + suggest

    function

    The `suggest` parameter looks like:
    ```
    (suggestion?: [FilenameSuggestion](#type-FilenameSuggestion)) => void
    ```

    - suggestion

      [FilenameSuggestion](#type-FilenameSuggestion) optional
### onErased

```
chrome.downloads.onErased.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fires with the `downloadId` when a download is erased from history.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (downloadId: number) => void
  ```

  + downloadId

    number

# chrome.enterprise.platformKeys  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/enterprise/platformKeys

# chrome.enterprise.platformKeys

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.enterprise.platformKeys` API to generate keys and install certificates for these keys. The certificates will be managed by the platform and can be used for TLS authentication, network access or by other extension through chrome.platformKeys.

## Permissions

`enterprise.platformKeys`  
## Availability

ChromeOS only

[Requires policy](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9296680)
## Concepts and usage

Typical usage of this API to enroll a client certificate follows these steps:

* Get all available tokens using [`enterprise.platformKeys.getTokens()`](#method-getTokens).
* Find the Token with `id` equal to `"user"`. Use this Token subsequently.
* Generate a key pair using the `generateKey()` Token method (defined in SubtleCrypto). This will return handle to the key.
* Export the public key using the `exportKey()` Token method (defined in SubtleCrypto).
* Create the signature of the certification request's data using the `sign()` Token method (defined in SubtleCrypto).
* Complete the certification request and send it to the certification authority.
* If a certificate is received, import it using [`enterprise.platformKeys.importCertificate()``[3]

Here's an example that shows the major API interaction except the building and sending of the certification request:

```
function getUserToken(callback) {
  chrome.enterprise.platformKeys.getTokens(function(tokens) {
    for (var i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
      if (tokens[i].id == "user") {
        callback(tokens[i]);
        return;
      }
    }
    callback(undefined);
  });
}

function generateAndSign(userToken) {
  var data = new Uint8Array([0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
  var algorithm = {
    name: "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5",
    // RsaHashedKeyGenParams
    modulusLength: 2048,
    publicExponent:
        new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x00, 0x01]),  // Equivalent to 65537
    hash: {
      name: "SHA-256",
    }
  };
  var cachedKeyPair;
  userToken.subtleCrypto.generateKey(algorithm, false, ["sign"])
    .then(function(keyPair) {
            cachedKeyPair = keyPair;
            return userToken.subtleCrypto.exportKey("spki", keyPair.publicKey);
          },
          console.log.bind(console))
    .then(function(publicKeySpki) {
            // Build the Certification Request using the public key.
            return userToken.subtleCrypto.sign(
                {name : "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5"}, cachedKeyPair.privateKey, data);
          },
          console.log.bind(console))
    .then(function(signature) {
              // Complete the Certification Request with |signature|.
              // Send out the request to the CA, calling back
              // onClientCertificateReceived.
          },
          console.log.bind(console));
}

function onClientCertificateReceived(userToken, certificate) {
  chrome.enterprise.platformKeys.importCertificate(userToken.id, certificate);
}

getUserToken(generateAndSign);

```

  A challenge as emitted by the Verified Access Web API.
* registerKey

  [RegisterKeyOptions](#type-RegisterKeyOptions) optional

  If present, registers the challenged key with the specified `scope`'s token. The key can then be associated with a certificate and used like any other signing key. Subsequent calls to this function will then generate a new Enterprise Key in the specified `scope`.

#### Enum

"USER"   

"MACHINE"   

### Token

#### Properties

* id

  string

  Uniquely identifies this `Token`.

  Static IDs are `"user"` and `"system"`, referring to the platform's user-specific and the system-wide hardware token, respectively. Any other tokens (with other identifiers) might be returned by [`enterprise.platformKeys.getTokens`](#method-getTokens).
* softwareBackedSubtleCrypto

  SubtleCrypto

  Chrome 97+

  Implements the WebCrypto's [SubtleCrypto](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#subtlecrypto-interface) interface. The cryptographic operations, including key generation, are software-backed. Protection of the keys, and thus implementation of the non-extractable property, is done in software, so the keys are less protected than hardware-backed keys.

  Only non-extractable keys can be generated. The supported key types are RSASSA-PKCS1-V1\_5 and RSA-OAEP (on Chrome versions 134+) with `modulusLength` up to 2048. Each RSASSA-PKCS1-V1\_5 key can be used for signing data at most once, unless the extension is allowlisted through the [KeyPermissions policy](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#KeyPermissions), in which case the key can be used indefinitely. RSA-OAEP keys are supported since Chrome version 134 and can be used by extensions allowlisted through that same policy to unwrap other keys.

  Keys generated on a specific `Token` cannot be used with any other Tokens, nor can they be used with `window.crypto.subtle`. Equally, `Key` objects created with `window.crypto.subtle` cannot be used with this interface.

## Methods

### challengeKey()

Promise
Chrome 110+

```
chrome.enterprise.platformKeys.challengeKey(  
  options: [ChallengeKeyOptions](#type-ChallengeKeyOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Similar to `challengeMachineKey` and `challengeUserKey`, but allows specifying the algorithm of a registered key. Challenges a hardware-backed Enterprise Machine Key and emits the response as part of a remote attestation protocol. Only useful on ChromeOS and in conjunction with the Verified Access Web API which both issues challenges and verifies responses.

A successful verification by the Verified Access Web API is a strong signal that the current device is a legitimate ChromeOS device, the current device is managed by the domain specified during verification, the current signed-in user is managed by the domain specified during verification, and the current device state complies with enterprise device policy. For example, a policy may specify that the device must not be in developer mode. Any device identity emitted by the verification is tightly bound to the hardware of the current device. If `"user"` Scope is specified, the identity is also tightly bound to the current signed-in user.

This function is highly restricted and will fail if the current device is not managed, the current user is not managed, or if this operation has not explicitly been enabled for the caller by enterprise device policy. The challenged key does not reside in the `"system"` or `"user"` token and is not accessible by any other API.

#### Parameters

* options

  [ChallengeKeyOptions](#type-ChallengeKeyOptions)

  Object containing the fields defined in [`ChallengeKeyOptions`](#type-ChallengeKeyOptions).
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (response: ArrayBuffer) => void
  ```

  + response

    ArrayBuffer

    The challenge response.
#### Returns

* Promise<ArrayBuffer>

  Chrome 131+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### challengeMachineKey()

Promise
Chrome 50+
Deprecated since Chrome 110
```
chrome.enterprise.platformKeys.challengeMachineKey(  
  challenge: ArrayBuffer,  
  registerKey?: boolean,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Use [`challengeKey`](#method-challengeKey) instead.

Challenges a hardware-backed Enterprise Machine Key and emits the response as part of a remote attestation protocol. Only useful on ChromeOS and in conjunction with the Verified Access Web API which both issues challenges and verifies responses. A successful verification by the Verified Access Web API is a strong signal of all of the following: \* The current device is a legitimate ChromeOS device. \* The current device is managed by the domain specified during verification. \* The current signed-in user is managed by the domain specified during verification. \* The current device state complies with enterprise device policy. For example, a policy may specify that the device must not be in developer mode. \* Any device identity emitted by the verification is tightly bound to the hardware of the current device. This function is highly restricted and will fail if the current device is not managed, the current user is not managed, or if this operation has not explicitly been enabled for the caller by enterprise device policy. The Enterprise Machine Key does not reside in the `"system"` token and is not accessible by any other API.

#### Parameters

* challenge

  ArrayBuffer

  A challenge as emitted by the Verified Access Web API.
* registerKey

  boolean optional

  Chrome 59+

  If set, the current Enterprise Machine Key is registered with the `"system"` token and relinquishes the Enterprise Machine Key role. The key can then be associated with a certificate and used like any other signing key. This key is 2048-bit RSA. Subsequent calls to this function will then generate a new Enterprise Machine Key.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (response: ArrayBuffer) => void
  ```

  + response

    ArrayBuffer

    The challenge response.
#### Returns

* Promise<ArrayBuffer>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### challengeUserKey()

Promise
Chrome 50+
Deprecated since Chrome 110
```
chrome.enterprise.platformKeys.challengeUserKey(  
  challenge: ArrayBuffer,  
  registerKey: boolean,

For example, a policy may specify that the device must not be in developer mode. \* The public key emitted by the verification is tightly bound to the hardware of the current device and to the current signed-in user. This function is highly restricted and will fail if the current device is not managed, the current user is not managed, or if this operation has not explicitly been enabled for the caller by enterprise user policy. The Enterprise User Key does not reside in the `"user"` token and is not accessible by any other API.

#### Parameters

* challenge

  ArrayBuffer

  A challenge as emitted by the Verified Access Web API.
* registerKey

  boolean

  If set, the current Enterprise User Key is registered with the `"user"` token and relinquishes the Enterprise User Key role.

# chrome.events

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The `chrome.events` namespace contains common types used by APIs dispatching events to notify you when something interesting happens.

## Concepts and usage

An `Event` is an object that lets you be notified when something interesting happens. Here's an
example of using the `chrome.alarms.onAlarm` event to be notified whenever an alarm has elapsed:

```
chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener((alarm) => {
  appendToLog(`alarms.onAlarm -- name: ${alarm.name}, scheduledTime: ${alarm.scheduledTime}`);
});

```

As the example shows, you register for notification using `addListener()`. The argument to
`addListener()` is always a function that you define to handle the event, but the parameters to the
function depend on which event you're handling. Checking the documentation for [`alarms.onAlarm`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms#event-onAlarm),
you can see that the function has a single parameter: an [`alarms.Alarm`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms#type-Alarm) object that has details
about the elapsed alarm.

Example APIs using Events: [alarms](/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms), [i18n](/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n), [identity](/docs/extensions/reference/api/identity), [runtime](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime). Most [chrome
APIs](/docs/extensions/reference/api) do.

### Declarative Event Handlers

The declarative event handlers provide a means to define rules consisting of declarative conditions
and actions. Conditions are evaluated in the browser rather than the JavaScript engine which reduces
roundtrip latencies and allows for very high efficiency.

Declarative event handlers are used for example in the
[Declarative Content API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeContent). This page describes the underlying concepts of all declarative event
handlers.

#### Rules

The simplest possible rule consists of one or more conditions and one or more actions:

```
const rule = {
  conditions: [ /* my conditions */ ],
  actions: [ /* my actions */ ]
};

```

If any of the conditions is fulfilled, all actions are executed.

In addition to conditions and actions you may give each rule an identifier, which simplifies
unregistering previously registered rules, and a priority to define precedences among rules.
Priorities are only considered if rules conflict each other or need to be executed in a specific
order. Actions are executed in descending order of the priority of their rules.

```
const rule = {
  id: "my rule",  // optional, will be generated if not set.
  priority: 100,  // optional, defaults to 100.
  conditions: [ /* my conditions */ ],
  actions: [ /* my actions */ ]
};

```
#### Event objects

Event objects may support rules. These event objects don't call a callback function when
events happen but test whether any registered rule has at least one fulfilled condition and execute
the actions associated with this rule. Event objects supporting the declarative API have three
relevant methods: [`events.Event.addRules()`](#method-Event-addRules), [`events.Event.removeRules()`](#method-Event-removeRules), and
[`events.Event.getRules()`](#method-Event-getRules).

#### Add rules

To add rules call the `addRules()` function of the event object. It takes an array of rule instances
as its first parameter and a callback function that is called on completion.

```
const rule_list = [rule1, rule2, ...];
addRules(rule_list, (details) => {...});

```

If the rules were inserted successfully, the `details` parameter contains an array of inserted rules
appearing in the same order as in the passed `rule_list` where the optional parameters `id` and
`priority` were filled with the generated values. If any rule is invalid, for example, because it contained
an invalid condition or action, none of the rules are added and the [runtime.lastError](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#property-lastError) variable
is set when the callback function is called. Each rule in `rule_list` must contain a unique
identifier that is not already used by another rule or an empty identifier.

#### Remove rules

To remove rules call the `removeRules()` function. It accepts an optional array of rule identifiers
as its first parameter and a callback function as its second parameter.

```
const rule_ids = ["id1", "id2", ...];
removeRules(rule_ids, () => {...});

```

If `rule_ids` is an array of identifiers, all rules having identifiers listed in the array are
removed. If `rule_ids` lists an identifier, that is unknown, this identifier is silently ignored. If
`rule_ids` is `undefined`, all registered rules of this extension are removed. The `callback()`
function is called when the rules were removed.

#### Retrieve rules

To retrieve a list of registered rules, call the `getRules()` function. It accepts an
optional array of rule identifiers with the same semantics as `removeRules()` and a callback function.

```
const rule_ids = ["id1", "id2", ...];
getRules(rule_ids, (details) => {...});

```

The `details` parameter passed to the `callback()` function refers to an array of rules including
filled optional parameters.

#### Performance

To achieve maximum performance, you should keep the following guidelines in mind.

**Register and unregister rules in bulk.** After each registration or unregistration, Chrome needs to
update internal data structures. This update is an expensive operation.

Instead of
```
const rule1 = {...};
const rule2 = {...};
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule1]);
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule2]);
```

Prefer
```
const rule1 = {...};
const rule2 = {...};
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule1, rule2]);
```

**Prefer substring matching over regular expressions in an [events.UrlFilter](#type-UrlFilter).**
Substring based matching is extremely fast.

Instead of
```
const match = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: {urlMatches: "example.com/[^?]*foo" }
});
```

Prefer
```
const match = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: {hostSuffix: "example.com", pathContains: "foo"}
});
```

If there are many rules that share the same actions, merge the rules into one.
Rules trigger their actions as soon as a single condition is fulfilled. This speeds up the
matching and reduces memory consumption for duplicate action sets.

Instead of
```
const condition1 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com' }
});
const condition2 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'foobar.com' }
});
const rule1 = { conditions: [condition1],
                actions: [new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()]
              };
const rule2 = { conditions: [condition2],
                actions: [new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()]
              };
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule1, rule2]);
```

Prefer
```
const condition1 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com' }
});
const condition2 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'foobar.com' }
});
const rule = { conditions: [condition1, condition2],
              actions: [new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()]
             };
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule]);
```

### Filtered events

Filtered events are a mechanism that allows listeners to specify a subset of events that they are
interested in. A listener that uses a filter won't be invoked for events that don't pass the
filter, which makes the listening code more declarative and efficient. A [service worker](/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers) need
not be woken up to handle events it doesn't care about.

Filtered events are intended to allow a transition from manual filtering code.

Instead of
```
chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted.addListener((event) => {
  if (hasHostSuffix(event.url, 'google.com') ||
      hasHostSuffix(event.url, 'google.com.au')) {
    // ...
  }
});
```

Prefer
```
chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted.addListener((event) => {
  // ...
}, {url: [{hostSuffix: 'google.com'},
          {hostSuffix: 'google.com.au'}]});
```

Events support specific filters that are meaningful to that event. The list of filters that an event
supports will be listed in the documentation for that event in the "filters" section.

When matching URLs (as in the example above), event filters support the same URL matching
capabilities as expressible with a [`events.UrlFilter`](#type-UrlFilter), except for scheme and port matching.

    ```
### Rule

Description of a declarative rule for handling events.

#### Properties

* actions

  any[]

  List of actions that are triggered if one of the conditions is fulfilled.
* conditions

  any[]

  List of conditions that can trigger the actions.
* id

  string optional

  Optional identifier that allows referencing this rule.
* priority

  number optional

  Optional priority of this rule. Defaults to 100.
* tags

  string[] optional

  Tags can be used to annotate rules and perform operations on sets of rules.
### UrlFilter

Filters URLs for various criteria. See [event filtering](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/events/#filtered). All criteria are case sensitive.

#### Properties

* cidrBlocks

  string[] optional

  Chrome 123+

  Matches if the host part of the URL is an IP address and is contained in any of the CIDR blocks specified in the array.
* hostContains

  string optional

  Matches if the host name of the URL contains a specified string. To test whether a host name component has a prefix 'foo', use hostContains: '.foo'. This matches 'www.foobar.com' and 'foo.com', because an implicit dot is added at the beginning of the host name. Similarly, hostContains can be used to match against component suffix ('foo.') and to exactly match against components ('.foo.'). Suffix- and exact-matching for the last components need to be done separately using hostSuffix, because no implicit dot is added at the end of the host name.
* hostEquals

  string optional

  Matches if the host name of the URL is equal to a specified string.
* hostPrefix

  string optional

  Matches if the host name of the URL starts with a specified string.
* hostSuffix

  string optional

  Matches if the host name of the URL ends with a specified string.
* originAndPathMatches

  string optional

  Matches if the URL without query segment and fragment identifier matches a specified regular expression. Port numbers are stripped from the URL if they match the default port number. The regular expressions use the [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/doc/syntax.txt).
* pathContains

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL contains a specified string.
* pathEquals

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL is equal to a specified string.
* pathPrefix

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL starts with a specified string.
* pathSuffix

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL ends with a specified string.
* ports

  (number | number[])[] optional

  Matches if the port of the URL is contained in any of the specified port lists. For example `[80, 443, [1000, 1200]]` matches all requests on port 80, 443 and in the range 1000-1200.
* queryContains

  string optional

  Matches if the query segment of the URL contains a specified string.
* queryEquals

  string optional

  Matches if the query segment of the URL is equal to a specified string.
* queryPrefix

  string optional

  Matches if the query segment of the URL starts with a specified string.
* querySuffix

  string optional

  Matches if the query segment of the URL ends with a specified string.
* schemes

  string[] optional

  Matches if the scheme of the URL is equal to any of the schemes specified in the array.

Chrome 44+

The type of extension view.

#### Enum

"tab"   

"popup"   

## Properties

### inIncognitoContext

True for content scripts running inside incognito tabs, and for extension pages running inside an incognito process. The latter only applies to extensions with 'split' incognito\_behavior.

#### Type

boolean

## Methods

### getBackgroundPage()

Foreground only

```
chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage()
```

Returns the JavaScript 'window' object for the background page running inside the current extension. Returns null if the extension has no background page.

#### Returns

* Window | undefined
### getViews()

Foreground only

```
chrome.extension.getViews(  
  fetchProperties?: object,  
)
```

Returns an array of the JavaScript 'window' objects for each of the pages running inside the current extension.

#### Parameters

* fetchProperties

  object optional

  + tabId

    number optional

    Chrome 54+

    Find a view according to a tab id. If this field is omitted, returns all views.

    [ViewType](#type-ViewType) optional

    The type of view to get. If omitted, returns all views (including background pages and tabs).
  + windowId

    number optional

    The window to restrict the search to. If omitted, returns all views.
#### Returns

* Window[]

  Array of global objects
### isAllowedFileSchemeAccess()

Promise

```
chrome.extension.isAllowedFileSchemeAccess(  
  callback?: function,

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (isAllowedAccess: boolean) => void
  ```

  + isAllowedAccess

    boolean

    True if the extension can access the 'file://' scheme, false otherwise.
#### Returns

* Promise<boolean>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### isAllowedIncognitoAccess()

Promise

```
chrome.extension.isAllowedIncognitoAccess(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Retrieves the state of the extension's access to Incognito-mode. This corresponds to the user-controlled per-extension 'Allowed in Incognito' setting accessible via the chrome://extensions page.

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (isAllowedAccess: boolean) => void
  ```

  + isAllowedAccess

    boolean

    True if the extension has access to Incognito mode, false otherwise.
#### Returns

* Promise<boolean>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### setUpdateUrlData()

```
chrome.extension.setUpdateUrlData(  
  data: string,  
)
```

# chrome.extensionTypes

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The `chrome.extensionTypes` API contains type declarations for Chrome extensions.

## Types

### CSSOrigin

Chrome 66+

The [origin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/#cascading-origins) of injected CSS.

#### Enum

"author"   

"user"   

### DeleteInjectionDetails

Chrome 87+

Details of the CSS to remove. Either the code or the file property must be set, but both may not be set at the same time.

#### Properties

* allFrames

  boolean optional

  If allFrames is `true`, implies that the CSS should be removed from all frames of current page. By default, it's `false` and is only removed from the top frame. If `true` and `frameId` is set, then the code is removed from the selected frame and all of its child frames.
* code

  string optional

  CSS code to remove.
* cssOrigin

  [CSSOrigin](#type-CSSOrigin) optional

  The [origin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/#cascading-origins) of the CSS to remove. Defaults to `"author"`.
* file

  string optional

  CSS file to remove.
* frameId

  number optional

  The [frame](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation/#frame_ids) from where the CSS should be removed. Defaults to 0 (the top-level frame).
* matchAboutBlank

  boolean optional

  If matchAboutBlank is true, then the code is also removed from about:blank and about:srcdoc frames if your extension has access to its parent document. By default it is `false`.
### DocumentLifecycle

Chrome 106+

The document lifecycle of the frame.

#### Enum

"prerender"   

"active"   

"cached"   

"pending\_deletion"   

### ExecutionWorld

Chrome 111+

The JavaScript world for a script to execute within. Can either be an isolated world unique to this extension, the main world of the DOM which is shared with the page's JavaScript, or a user scripts world that is only available for scripts registered with the User Scripts API.

#### Enum

"ISOLATED"   

"MAIN"   

"USER\_SCRIPT"   

### FrameType

Chrome 106+

The type of frame.

#### Enum

"outermost\_frame"   

"fenced\_frame"   

"sub\_frame"   

### ImageDetails

Details about the format and quality of an image.

#### Properties

* format

  [ImageFormat](#type-ImageFormat) optional

  The format of the resulting image. Default is `"jpeg"`.
* quality

  number optional

  When format is `"jpeg"`, controls the quality of the resulting image. This value is ignored for PNG images. As quality is decreased, the resulting image will have more visual artifacts, and the number of bytes needed to store it will decrease.
### ImageFormat

Chrome 44+

The format of an image.

#### Enum

"jpeg"   

"png"   

### InjectDetails

Details of the script or CSS to inject. Either the code or the file property must be set, but both may not be set at the same time.

#### Properties

* allFrames

  boolean optional

  If allFrames is `true`, implies that the JavaScript or CSS should be injected into all frames of current page. By default, it's `false` and is only injected into the top frame. If `true` and `frameId` is set, then the code is inserted in the selected frame and all of its child frames.
* code

  string optional

  JavaScript or CSS code to inject.

  **Warning:** Be careful using the `code` parameter. Incorrect use of it may open your extension to [cross site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks
* cssOrigin

  [CSSOrigin](#type-CSSOrigin) optional

  Chrome 66+

  The [origin](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/#cascading-origins) of the CSS to inject. This may only be specified for CSS, not JavaScript. Defaults to `"author"`.
* file

  string optional

  JavaScript or CSS file to inject.
* frameId

  number optional

  Chrome 50+

  The [frame](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation/#frame_ids) where the script or CSS should be injected. Defaults to 0 (the top-level frame).
* matchAboutBlank

  boolean optional

  If matchAboutBlank is true, then the code is also injected in about:blank and about:srcdoc frames if your extension has access to its parent document. Code cannot be inserted in top-level about:-frames. By default it is `false`.
* runAt

  [RunAt](#type-RunAt) optional

  The soonest that the JavaScript or CSS will be injected into the tab. Defaults to "document\_idle".
### RunAt

Chrome 44+

The soonest that the JavaScript or CSS will be injected into the tab.

#### Enum

"document\_start"   
 Script is injected after any files from css, but before any other DOM is constructed or any other script is run.

"document\_end"   
 Script is injected immediately after the DOM is complete, but before subresources like images and frames have loaded.

"document\_idle"   
 The browser chooses a time to inject the script between "document\_end" and immediately after the `window.onload` event fires. The exact moment of injection depends on how complex the document is and how long it is taking to load, and is optimized for page load speed. Content scripts running at "document\_idle" don't need to listen for the `window.onload` event; they are guaranteed to run after the DOM completes. If a script definitely needs to run after `window.onload`, the extension can check if `onload` has already fired by using the `document.readyState` property.

# chrome.fileBrowserHandler  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/fileBrowserHandler

# chrome.fileBrowserHandler

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.fileBrowserHandler` API to extend the Chrome OS file browser. For example, you can use this API to enable users to upload files to your website.

## Concepts and usage

The ChromeOS file browser comes up when the user either presses Alt+Shift+M or connects an external storage device, such as an SD card, USB key, external drive, or digital camera. Besides showing the files on external devices, the file browser can also display files that the user has previously saved to the system.

When the user selects one or more files, the file browser adds buttons representing the valid handlers for those files. For example, in the following screenshot, selecting a file with a ".png" suffix results in an "Save to Gallery" button that the user can click.

## Permissions

`fileBrowserHandler`  

You must declare the `"fileBrowserHandler"` permission in the [extension manifest](/extensions/reference/manifest).

## Availability

ChromeOS only
Foreground only

You must use the `"file_browser_handlers"` field to register the extension as a handler of at least one file type. You should also provide a 16 by 16 icon to be displayed on the button. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "file_browser_handlers": [
    {
      "id": "upload",
      "default_title": "Save to Gallery", // What the button will display
      "file_filters": [
        "filesystem:*.jpg",  // To match all files, use "filesystem:*.*"
        "filesystem:*.jpeg",
        "filesystem:*.png"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "permissions" : [
    "fileBrowserHandler"
  ],
  "icons": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  },
  ...
}

```
### Implement a file browser handler

To use this API, you must implement a function that handles the `onExecute` event of `chrome.fileBrowserHandler`. Your function will be called whenever the user clicks the button that represents your file browser handler. In your function, use the [File System API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileEntry) to get access to the file contents. Here is an example:

```
chrome.fileBrowserHandler.onExecute.addListener(async (id, details) => {
  if (id !== 'upload') {
    return;  // check if you have multiple file_browser_handlers
  }

  for (const entry of detail.entries) {
    // the FileSystemFileEntry doesn't have a Promise API, wrap in one
    const file = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      entry.file(resolve, reject);
    });
    const buffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
    // do something with buffer
  }
});

```

Your event handler is passed two arguments:

`id`
The `id` value from the manifest file. If your extension implements multiple handlers, you can check the ID value to see which handler has been triggered.
`details`
An object describing the event. You can get the file or files that the user has selected from the `entries` field of this object, which is an array of `FileSystemFileEntry` objects.
## Types

### FileHandlerExecuteEventDetails

Event details payload for fileBrowserHandler.onExecute event.

#### Properties

* entries

  any[]

  Array of Entry instances representing files that are targets of this action (selected in ChromeOS file browser).
* tab\_id

  number optional

  The ID of the tab that raised this event. Tab IDs are unique within a browser session.
## Events

### onExecute

```
chrome.fileBrowserHandler.onExecute.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when file system action is executed from ChromeOS file browser.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (id: string, details: [FileHandlerExecuteEventDetails](#type-FileHandlerExecuteEventDetails)) => void
  ```

  + id

    string
  + details

    [FileHandlerExecuteEventDetails](#type-FileHandlerExecuteEventDetails)

You must declare the "fileSystemProvider" permission and section in the [extension manifest](/extensions/manifest) to use the File System Provider API. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "fileSystemProvider"
  ],
  ...
  "file_system_provider_capabilities": {
    "configurable": true,
    "watchable": false,
    "multiple_mounts": true,
    "source": "network"
  },
  ...
}

```

The file\_system\_provider section must be declared as follows:

**`configurable` (boolean)** - optional
Whether configuring via onConfigureRequested is supported. By default: false.
**`multiple_mounts` (boolean)** - optional
Whether multiple (more than one) mounted file systems are supported. By default: false.
**`watchable` (boolean)** - optional
Whether setting watchers and notifying about changes is supported. By default: false.
**`source` (enum of "file", "device", or "network")** - required
Source of data for mounted file systems.

Files app uses above information in order to render related UI elements appropriately. For example, if `configurable` is set to true, then a menu item for configuring volumes will be rendered. Similarly, if `multiple_mounts` is set to `true`, then Files app will allow to add more than one mount points from the UI. If `watchable` is `false`, then a refresh button will be rendered. Note, that if possible you should add support for watchers, so changes on the file system can be reflected immediately and automatically.

## Overview

File System Provider API allows extensions to support virtual file systems, which are available in the file manager on ChromeOS. Use cases include decompressing archives and accessing files in a cloud service other than Drive.

## Mounting file systems

Providing extensions can either provide file system contents from an external source (such as a remote server or a USB device), or using a local file (such as an archive) as its input.

In order to write file systems which are file handlers (source is `"file"`) the provider must be a packaged app, as the `onLaunched` event is not available to extensions.

If the source is network or a device, then the file system should be mounted when [onMountRequested](#event-onMountRequested) event is called.

| [Source](#manifest-source) of the file system data | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| `"file"` | Available to packaged apps only. |
| `"device"` or `"network"` | [onMountRequested](#event-onMountRequested) |

## Configuring file systems

Provided file systems once mounted can be configured via the [onConfigureRequested](#event-onConfigureRequested) event. It's especially useful for file systems which provide contents via network in order to set proper credentials. Handling this event is optional.

## Life cycle

Provided file systems once mounted are remembered by Chrome and remounted automatically after reboot or restart. Hence, once a file system is [mounted](#method-mount) by a providing extension, it will stay until either the extension is unloaded, or the extension calls the [unmount](#method-unmount) method.

## Methods

### get()

Promise

```
chrome.fileSystemProvider.get(  
  fileSystemId: string,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Returns information about a file system with the passed `fileSystemId`.

#### Parameters

* fileSystemId

  string
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (fileSystem: [FileSystemInfo](#type-FileSystemInfo)) => void
  ```

  + fileSystem

    [FileSystemInfo](#type-FileSystemInfo)
#### Returns

* Promise<[FileSystemInfo](#type-FileSystemInfo)>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getAll()

Promise

```
chrome.fileSystemProvider.getAll(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Returns all file systems mounted by the extension.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (fileSystems: [FileSystemInfo](#type-FileSystemInfo)[]) => void
  ```

  + fileSystems

    [FileSystemInfo](#type-FileSystemInfo)[]
#### Returns

* Promise<[FileSystemInfo](#type-FileSystemInfo)[]>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### mount()

Promise

```
chrome.fileSystemProvider.mount(  
  options: [MountOptions](#type-MountOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Mounts a file system with the given `fileSystemId` and `displayName`. `displayName` will be shown in the left panel of the Files app. `displayName` can contain any characters including '/', but cannot be an empty string. `displayName` must be descriptive but doesn't have to be unique. The `fileSystemId` must not be an empty string.

Depending on the type of the file system being mounted, the `source` option must be set appropriately.

In case of an error, [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) will be set with a corresponding error code.

#### Parameters

* options

  [MountOptions](#type-MountOptions)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### notify()

Promise
Chrome 45+

```
chrome.fileSystemProvider.notify(  
  options: [NotifyOptions](#type-NotifyOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Notifies about changes in the watched directory at `observedPath` in `recursive` mode. If the file system is mounted with `supportsNotifyTag`, then `tag` must be provided, and all changes since the last notification always reported, even if the system was shutdown. The last tag can be obtained with [`getAll`](#method-getAll).

To use, the `file_system_provider.notify` manifest option must be set to true.

Value of `tag` can be any string which is unique per call, so it's possible to identify the last registered notification. Eg. if the providing extension starts after a reboot, and the last registered notification's tag is equal to "123", then it should call [`notify`](#method-notify) for all changes which happened since the change tagged as "123". It cannot be an empty string.

Not all providers are able to provide a tag, but if the file system has a changelog, then the tag can be eg. a change number, or a revision number.

Note that if a parent directory is removed, then all descendant entries are also removed, and if they are watched, then the API must be notified about the fact. Also, if a directory is renamed, then all descendant entries are in fact removed, as there is no entry under their original paths anymore.

In case of an error, [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) will be set will a corresponding error code.

#### Parameters

* options

  [NotifyOptions](#type-NotifyOptions)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

chrome.fileSystemProvider.unmount(  
  options: [UnmountOptions](#type-UnmountOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Unmounts a file system with the given `fileSystemId`. It must be called after [`onUnmountRequested`](#event-onUnmountRequested) is invoked. Also, the providing extension can decide to perform unmounting if not requested (eg. in case of lost connection, or a file error).

In case of an error, [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) will be set with a corresponding error code.

#### Parameters

* options

  [UnmountOptions](#type-UnmountOptions)

# chrome.fontSettings  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/fontSettings

# chrome.fontSettings

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.fontSettings` API to manage Chrome's font settings.

## Permissions

`fontSettings`  

To use the Font Settings API, you must declare the `"fontSettings"` permission in the [extension
manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My Font Settings Extension",
  "description": "Customize your fonts",
  "version": "0.2",
  "permissions": [
    "fontSettings"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

Chrome allows for some font settings to depend on certain generic font families and language
scripts. For example, the font used for sans-serif Simplified Chinese may be different than the font
used for serif Japanese.

The generic font families supported by Chrome are based on [CSS generic font families](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html#generic-font-families) and are
listed under [`GenericReference`](#type-GenericFamily). When a web page specifies a generic font family, Chrome selects
the font based on the corresponding setting. If no generic font family is specified, Chrome uses the
setting for the "standard" generic font family.

When a web page specifies a language, Chrome selects the font based on the setting for the
corresponding language script. If no language is specified, Chrome uses the setting for the default,
or global, script.

The supported language scripts are specified by ISO 15924 script code and listed under
[`ScriptCode`](#type-ScriptCode). Technically, Chrome settings are not strictly per-script but also depend on
language. For example, Chrome chooses the font for Cyrillic (ISO 15924 script code "Cyrl") when a
web page specifies the Russian language, and uses this font not just for Cyrillic script but for
everything the font covers, such as Latin.

## Examples

The following code gets the standard font for Arabic.

```
chrome.fontSettings.getFont(
  { genericFamily: 'standard', script: 'Arab' },
  function(details) { console.log(details.fontId); }
);

```

The next snippet sets the sans-serif font for Japanese.

```
chrome.fontSettings.setFont(
  { genericFamily: 'sansserif', script: 'Jpan', fontId: 'MS PGothic' }
);

```

To try this API, install the [fontSettings API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/fontSettings) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)

# chrome.history  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/history

# chrome.history

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.history` API to interact with the browser's record of visited pages. You can add, remove, and query for URLs in the browser's history. To override the history page with your own version, see [Override Pages](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/ui/override-chrome-pages).

## Permissions

`history`  

To interact with the user's browser history, use the history API.

To use the history API, declare the `"history"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest). For
example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "history"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Transition types

The history API uses transition types to describe how the browser navigated to a particular URL
on a particular visit. For example, if a user visits a page by clicking a link on another page, the
transition type is "link". See the [reference content](#type-TransitionType) for a list of
transition types.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [history API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/history) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

### HistoryItem

An object encapsulating one result of a history query.

#### Properties

* id

  string

  The unique identifier for the item.
* lastVisitTime

  number optional

  When this page was last loaded, represented in milliseconds since the epoch.
* title

  string optional

  The title of the page when it was last loaded.
* typedCount

  number optional

  The number of times the user has navigated to this page by typing in the address.
* url

  string optional

  The URL navigated to by a user.
* visitCount

  number optional

  The number of times the user has navigated to this page.
### TransitionType

Chrome 44+

The [transition type](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/history/#transition_types) for this visit from its referrer.

#### Enum

"link"   
 The user arrived at this page by clicking a link on another page.

"typed"   
 The user arrived at this page by typing the URL in the address bar. This is also used for other explicit navigation actions.

"auto\_bookmark"   
 The user arrived at this page through a suggestion in the UI, for example, through a menu item.

"auto\_subframe"   
 The user arrived at this page through subframe navigation that they didn't request, such as through an ad loading in a frame on the previous page. These don't always generate new navigation entries in the back and forward menus.

"manual\_subframe"   
 The user arrived at this page by selecting something in a subframe.

"generated"   
 The user arrived at this page by typing in the address bar and selecting an entry that didn't look like a URL, such as a Google Search suggestion. For example, a match might have the URL of a Google Search result page, but it might appear to the user as "Search Google for ...". These are different from typed navigations because the user didn't type or see the destination URL. They're also related to keyword navigations.

"auto\_toplevel"   
 The page was specified in the command line or is the start page.

"form\_submit"   
 The user arrived at this page by filling out values in a form and submitting the form. Not all form submissions use this transition type.

"reload"   
 The user reloaded the page, either by clicking the reload button or by pressing Enter in the address bar. Session restore and Reopen closed tab also use this transition type.

"keyword"   
 The URL for this page was generated from a replaceable keyword other than the default search provider.

"keyword\_generated"   
 Corresponds to a visit generated for a keyword.

### UrlDetails

Chrome 88+

#### Properties

* url

  string

  The URL for the operation. It must be in the format as returned from a call to `history.search()`.
### VisitItem

An object encapsulating one visit to a URL.

#### Properties

* id

  string

  The unique identifier for the corresponding [`history.HistoryItem`](#type-HistoryItem).
* isLocal

  boolean

  Chrome 115+

  True if the visit originated on this device. False if it was synced from a different device.
* referringVisitId

  string

  The visit ID of the referrer.
* transition

  [TransitionType](#type-TransitionType)

  The [transition type](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/history/#transition_types) for this visit from its referrer.

    Limit results to those visited before this date, represented in milliseconds since the epoch.
  + maxResults

    number optional

    The maximum number of results to retrieve. Defaults to 100.
  + startTime

    number optional

    Limit results to those visited after this date, represented in milliseconds since the epoch. If property is not specified, it will default to 24 hours.
  + text

    string

    A free-text query to the history service. Leave this empty to retrieve all pages.
* callback

  function optional

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n

# chrome.i18n

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.i18n` infrastructure to implement internationalization across your whole app or extension.

## Manifest

If an extension has a `/_locales` directory, the [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) must define `"default_locale"`.

## Concepts and usage

You need to put all of its user-visible strings into a file named [`messages.json`](/docs/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats). Each time
you add a new locale, you add a messages file under a directory named `/_locales/_localeCode_`, where
*localeCode* is a code such as `en` for English.

Here's the file hierarchy for an internationalized extension that supports English (`en`), Spanish
(`es`), and Korean (`ko`):

### Support multiple languages

Say you have an extension with the files shown in the following figure:

To internationalize this extension, you name each user-visible string and put it into a messages
file. The extension's manifest, CSS files, and JavaScript code use each string's name to get its
localized version.

Here's what the extension looks like when it's internationalized (note that it still has only
English strings):

Some notes about internationalizing:

* You can use any of the [supported locales](#locales). If you use an unsupported locale, Google Chrome
  ignores it.
* In `manifest.json` and CSS files, refer to a string named *messagename* like this:

  ```
  __MSG_messagename__

  ```
* In your extension or app's JavaScript code, refer to a string named *messagename* like this:

  ```
  chrome.i18n.getMessage("messagename")

  ```
* In each call to `getMessage()`, you can supply up to 9 strings to be included in the message. See
  [Examples: getMessage](#getmessage) for details.
* Some messages, such as `@@bidi_dir` and `@@ui_locale`, are provided by the internationalization
  system. See the [Predefined messages](#overview-predefined) section for a full list of predefined message names.
* In `messages.json`, each user-visible string has a name, a "message" item, and an optional
  "description" item. The name is a key such as "extName" or "search\_string" that identifies the
  string. The "message" specifies the value of the string in this locale. The optional "description"
  provides help to translators, who might not be able to see how the string is used in your
  extension. For example:

  ```
  {
    "search_string": {
      "message": "hello%20world",
      "description": "The string we search for. Put %20 between words that go together."
    },
    ...
  }

  ```

For more information, see [Formats: Locale-Specific Messages](/docs/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats).

Once an extension is internationalized, translating it is straightforward. You copy `messages.json`,
translate it, and put the copy into a new directory under `/_locales`. For example, to support
Spanish, just put a translated copy of `messages.json` under `/_locales/es`. The following figure
shows the previous extension with a new Spanish translation.

### Predefined messages

The internationalization system provides a few predefined messages to help you localize. These
include `@@ui_locale`, so you can detect the current UI locale, and a few `@@bidi_...` messages that
let you detect the text direction. The latter messages have similar names to constants in the
[gadgets BIDI (bi-directional) API](https://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/i18n.html#BIDI).

The special message `@@extension_id` can be used in the CSS and JavaScript files, whether or not the
extension or app is localized. This message doesn't work in manifest files.

The following table describes each predefined message.

| Message name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@@extension_id` | The extension or app ID; you might use this string to construct URLs for resources inside the extension. Even unlocalized extensions can use this message.**Note:** You can't use this message in a manifest file. |
| `@@ui_locale` | The current locale; you might use this string to construct locale-specific URLs. |
| `@@bidi_dir` | The text direction for the current locale, either "ltr" for left-to-right languages such as English or "rtl" for right-to-left languages such as Arabic. |
| `@@bidi_reversed_dir` | If the `@@bidi_dir` is "ltr", then this is "rtl"; otherwise, it's "ltr". |
| `@@bidi_start_edge` | If the `@@bidi_dir` is "ltr", then this is "left"; otherwise, it's "right". |
| `@@bidi_end_edge` | If the `@@bidi_dir` is "ltr", then this is "right"; otherwise, it's "left". |

Here's an example of using `@@extension_id` in a CSS file to construct a URL:

```
body {
  background-image:url('chrome-extension://__MSG_@@extension_id__/background.png');
}

```

If the extension ID is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef, then the bold line in the previous code
snippet becomes:

```
  background-image:url('chrome-extension://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef/background.png');

```

Here's an example of using `@@bidi_*` messages in a CSS file:

```
body {
  direction: __MSG_@@bidi_dir__;
}

div#header {
  margin-bottom: 1.05em;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-bottom: 1.5em;
  padding-__MSG_@@bidi_start_edge__: 0;
  padding-__MSG_@@bidi_end_edge__: 1.5em;
  position: relative;
}

```

For left-to-right languages such as English, the bold lines become:

```
  dir: ltr;
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-right: 1.5em;

```
### Locales

You can choose from many locales, including some (such as `en`) that let a single translation support multiple variations of a language (such as `en_GB` and `en_US`).

You can localize your extension to any locale that is supported by the Chrome Web Store. If your locale is not listed here, choose the closest alternative. For example, if the default locale of your extension is `"de_CH"`, choose `"de"` in the Chrome Web Store.

| Locale code | Language (region) |
| --- | --- |
| ar | Arabic |
| am | Amharic |
| bg | Bulgarian |
| bn | Bengali |
| ca | Catalan |
| cs | Czech |
| da | Danish |
| de | German |
| el | Greek |
| en | English |
| en\_AU | English (Australia) |
| en\_GB | English (Great Britain) |
| en\_US | English (USA) |
| es | Spanish |
| es\_419 | Spanish (Latin America and Caribbean) |
| et | Estonian |
| fa | Persian |
| fi | Finnish |
| fil | Filipino |
| fr | French |
| gu | Gujarati |
| he | Hebrew |
| hi | Hindi |
| hr | Croatian |
| hu | Hungarian |
| id | Indonesian |
| it | Italian |
| ja | Japanese |
| kn | Kannada |
| ko | Korean |
| lt | Lithuanian |
| lv | Latvian |
| ml | Malayalam |
| mr | Marathi |
| ms | Malay |
| nl | Dutch |
| no | Norwegian |
| pl | Polish |
| pt\_BR | Portuguese (Brazil) |
| pt\_PT | Portuguese (Portugal) |
| ro | Romanian |
| ru | Russian |
| sk | Slovak |
| sl | Slovenian |
| sr | Serbian |
| sv | Swedish |
| sw | Swahili |
| ta | Tamil |
| te | Telugu |
| th | Thai |
| tr | Turkish |
| uk | Ukrainian |
| vi | Vietnamese |
| zh\_CN | Chinese (China) |
| zh\_TW | Chinese (Taiwan) |

### Search for messages

You don't have to define every string for every supported locale. As long as the default locale's
`messages.json` file has a value for every string, your extension or app will run no matter how
sparse a translation is. Here's how the extension system searches for a message:

1. Search the messages file (if any) for the user's preferred locale. For example, when Google
   Chrome's locale is set to British English (`en_GB`), the system first looks for the message in
   `/_locales/en_GB/messages.json`. If that file exists and the message is there, the system looks
   no further.
2. If the user's preferred locale has a region (that is, the locale has an underscore: \_), search
   the locale without that region. For example, if the `en_GB` messages file doesn't exist or
   doesn't contain the message, the system looks in the `en` messages file. If that file exists and
   the message is there, the system looks no further.
3. Search the messages file for the default locale. For example, if the extension's
   "default\_locale" is set to "es", and neither `/_locales/en_GB/messages.json` nor
   `/_locales/en/messages.json` contains the message, the extension uses the message from
   `/_locales/es/messages.json`.

In the following figure, the message named "colores" is in all three locales that the extension
supports, but "extName" is in only two of the locales. Wherever a user running Google Chrome in US
English sees the label "Colors", a user of British English sees "Colours". Both US English and
British English users see the extension name "Hello World". Because the default language is Spanish,
users running Google Chrome in any non-English language see the label "Colores" and the extension
name "Hola mundo".

### Set your browser's locale

To test translations, you might want to set your browser's locale. This section tells you how to set
the locale in [Windows](#windows), [Mac OS](#mac_os), [Linux](#linux), and [ChromeOS](#chromeos).

#### Windows

You can change the locale using either a locale-specific shortcut or the Google Chrome UI. The
shortcut approach is quicker, once you've set it up, and it lets you use several languages at once.

##### Use a locale-specific shortcut

To create and use a shortcut that launches Google Chrome with a particular locale:

1. Make a copy of the Google Chrome shortcut that's already on your desktop.
2. Rename the new shortcut to match the new locale.
3. Change the shortcut's properties so that the Target field specifies the `--lang` and
   `--user-data-dir` flags. The target should look something like this:

   ```
   path_to_chrome.exe --lang=locale --user-data-dir=c:\locale_profile_dir

   ```
4. Launch Google Chrome by double-clicking the shortcut.

For example, to create a shortcut that launches Google Chrome in Spanish (`es`), you might create a
shortcut named `chrome-es` that has the following target:

```
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=es --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-es

```

You can create as many shortcuts as you like, making it straightforward to test in multiple languages. For
example:

```
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=en --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-en
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=en_GB --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-en_GB
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=ko --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-ko

```
##### Use the UI

Here's how to change the locale using the UI on Google Chrome for Windows:

1. App icon > **Options**
2. Choose the **Under the Hood** tab
3. Scroll to **Web Content**
4. Click **Change font and language settings**
5. Choose the **Languages** tab
6. Use the drop down to set the **Google Chrome language**
7. Restart Chrome

#### Mac OS

To change the locale on Mac, you use the system preferences.

1. From the Apple menu, choose **System Preferences**
2. Under the **Personal** section, choose **International**
3. Choose your language and location
4. Restart Chrome

#### Linux

To change the locale on Linux, first quit Google Chrome. Then, all in one line, set the LANGUAGE
environment variable and launch Google Chrome. For example:

```
LANGUAGE=es ./chrome

```
#### ChromeOS

To change the locale on ChromeOS:

1. From the system tray, choose **Settings**.
2. Under the **Languages and input** section, choose the **Language** drop-down.
3. If your language is not listed, click **Add languages** and add it.
4. Once added, click the 3-dot **More actions** menu item next to your language and choose
   **Display ChromeOS in this language**.
5. Click the **Restart** button that appears next to the set language to restart ChromeOS.

## Examples

You can find examples of internationalization in the [examples/api/i18n](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/_archive/mv2/api/i18n/) directory. For a
complete example, see [examples/extensions/news](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/_archive/mv2/extensions/news/). For other examples and for help in viewing the
source code, see [Samples](/docs/extensions/samples).

### getMessage()

The following code gets a localized message from the browser and displays it as a string. It
replaces two placeholders within the message with the strings "string1" and "string2".

```
function getMessage() {
  var message = chrome.i18n.getMessage("click_here", ["string1", "string2"]);
  document.getElementById("languageSpan").innerHTML = message;
}

```

Here's how you'd supply and use a single string:

```
  // In JavaScript code
  status.innerText = chrome.i18n.getMessage("error", errorDetails);

```
```
"error": {
  "message": "Error: $details$",
  "description": "Generic error template. Expects error parameter to be passed in.",
  "placeholders": {
    "details": {
      "content": "$1",
      "example": "Failed to fetch RSS feed."
    }
  }
}

```

For more information about placeholders, see the [Locale-Specific Messages](/docs/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats#placeholders) page. For details on
calling `getMessage()`, see the [API reference](#method-getMessage).

### getAcceptLanguages()

The following code gets accept-languages from the browser and displays them as a string by
separating each accept-language with ','.

```
function getAcceptLanguages() {
  chrome.i18n.getAcceptLanguages(function(languageList) {
    var languages = languageList.join(",");
    document.getElementById("languageSpan").innerHTML = languages;
  })
}

```

For details on calling `getAcceptLanguages()`, see the [API reference](#method-getAcceptLanguages).

### detectLanguage()

The following code detects up to 3 languages from the given string and displays the result as
strings separated by new lines.

```
function detectLanguage(inputText) {
  chrome.i18n.detectLanguage(inputText, function(result) {
    var outputLang = "Detected Language: ";
    var outputPercent = "Language Percentage: ";
    for(i = 0; i < result.languages.length; i++) {
      outputLang += result.languages[i].language + " ";
      outputPercent +=result.languages[i].percentage + " ";
    }
    document.getElementById("languageSpan").innerHTML = outputLang + "\n" + outputPercent + "\nReliable: " + result.isReliable;
  });
}

```

For more details on calling `detectLanguage(inputText)`, see the [API reference](#method-detectLanguage).

## Types

### LanguageCode

Chrome 47+

An ISO language code such as `en` or `fr`. For a complete list of languages supported by this method, see [kLanguageInfoTable](https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/third_party/cld/languages/internal/languages.cc). For an unknown language, `und` will be returned, which means that [percentage] of the text is unknown to CLD

#### Type

string

## Methods

### detectLanguage()

Promise
Chrome 47+

```
chrome.i18n.detectLanguage(  
  text: string,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Detects the language of the provided text using CLD.

#### Parameters

* text

  string

  User input string to be translated.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: object) => void
  ```

  + result

    object

    LanguageDetectionResult object that holds detected langugae reliability and array of DetectedLanguage

    - isReliable

      boolean

      CLD detected language reliability
    - languages

      object[]

      array of detectedLanguage

      * language

        string
      * percentage

        number

        The percentage of the detected language
#### Returns

* Promise<object>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getAcceptLanguages()

Promise

```
chrome.i18n.getAcceptLanguages(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Gets the accept-languages of the browser. This is different from the locale used by the browser; to get the locale, use [`i18n.getUILanguage`](#method-getUILanguage).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (languages: string[]) => void
  ```

  + languages

    string[]

    Array of LanguageCode
#### Returns

* Promise<[LanguageCode](#type-LanguageCode)[]>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getMessage()

```
chrome.i18n.getMessage(  
  messageName: string,  
  substitutions?: any,  
  options?: object,  
)
```

Gets the localized string for the specified message. If the message is missing, this method returns an empty string (''). If the format of the `getMessage()` call is wrong — for example, *messageName* is not a string or the *substitutions* array has more than 9 elements — this method returns `undefined`.

#### Parameters

* messageName

  string

  The name of the message, as specified in the [`messages.json`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats) file.
* substitutions

  any optional

  Up to 9 substitution strings, if the message requires any.
* options

  object optional

  Chrome 79+

  + escapeLt

    boolean optional

    Escape `<` in translation to `&lt;`. This applies only to the message itself, not to the placeholders. Developers might want to use this if the translation is used in an HTML context. Closure Templates used with Closure Compiler generate this automatically.
#### Returns

* string

  Message localized for current locale.
### getUILanguage()

```
chrome.i18n.getUILanguage()
```

Gets the browser UI language of the browser. This is different from [`i18n.getAcceptLanguages`](#method-getAcceptLanguages) which returns the preferred user languages.

#### Returns

* string

  The browser UI language code such as en-US or fr-FR.

# chrome.identity  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/identity

# chrome.identity

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.identity` API to get OAuth2 access tokens.

## Permissions

`identity`  
## Types

### AccountInfo

#### Properties

* id

  string

  A unique identifier for the account. This ID will not change for the lifetime of the account.
### AccountStatus

Chrome 84+

#### Enum

"SYNC"   
 Specifies that Sync is enabled for the primary account.

"ANY"   
 Specifies the existence of a primary account, if any.

### GetAuthTokenResult

Chrome 105+

#### Properties

* grantedScopes

  string[] optional

  A list of OAuth2 scopes granted to the extension.
* token

  string optional

  The specific token associated with the request.
### InvalidTokenDetails

#### Properties

* token

  string

  The specific token that should be removed from the cache.
### ProfileDetails

Chrome 84+

#### Properties

* accountStatus

  [AccountStatus](#type-AccountStatus) optional

  A status of the primary account signed into a profile whose `ProfileUserInfo` should be returned. Defaults to `SYNC` account status.
### ProfileUserInfo

#### Properties

* email

  string

  An email address for the user account signed into the current profile. Empty if the user is not signed in or the `identity.email` manifest permission is not specified.
* id

  string

  A unique identifier for the account. This ID will not change for the lifetime of the account. Empty if the user is not signed in or (in M41+) the `identity.email` manifest permission is not specified.
### TokenDetails

#### Properties

* account

  [AccountInfo](#type-AccountInfo) optional

  The account ID whose token should be returned. If not specified, the function will use an account from the Chrome profile: the Sync account if there is one, or otherwise the first Google web account.
* enableGranularPermissions

  boolean optional

  Chrome 87+

  The `enableGranularPermissions` flag allows extensions to opt-in early to the granular permissions consent screen, in which requested permissions are granted or denied individually.
* interactive

  boolean optional

  Fetching a token may require the user to sign-in to Chrome, or approve the application's requested scopes. If the interactive flag is `true`, `getAuthToken` will prompt the user as necessary. When the flag is `false` or omitted, `getAuthToken` will return failure any time a prompt would be required.
* scopes

  string[] optional

  A list of OAuth2 scopes to request.

  When the `scopes` field is present, it overrides the list of scopes specified in manifest.json.
### WebAuthFlowDetails

#### Properties

* abortOnLoadForNonInteractive

  boolean optional

  Chrome 113+

  Whether to terminate `launchWebAuthFlow` for non-interactive requests after the page loads. This parameter does not affect interactive flows.

  When set to `true` (default) the flow will terminate immediately after the page loads. When set to `false`, the flow will only terminate after the `timeoutMsForNonInteractive` passes. This is useful for identity providers that use JavaScript to perform redirections after the page loads.
* interactive

  boolean optional

  Whether to launch auth flow in interactive mode.

  Since some auth flows may immediately redirect to a result URL, `launchWebAuthFlow` hides its web view until the first navigation either redirects to the final URL, or finishes loading a page meant to be displayed.

  If the `interactive` flag is `true`, the window will be displayed when a page load completes. If the flag is `false` or omitted, `launchWebAuthFlow` will return with an error if the initial navigation does not complete the flow.

  For flows that use JavaScript for redirection, `abortOnLoadForNonInteractive` can be set to `false` in combination with setting `timeoutMsForNonInteractive` to give the page a chance to perform any redirects.
* timeoutMsForNonInteractive

  number optional

  Chrome 113+

  The maximum amount of time, in miliseconds, `launchWebAuthFlow` is allowed to run in non-interactive mode in total. Only has an effect if `interactive` is `false`.
* url

  string

  The URL that initiates the auth flow.
## Methods

### clearAllCachedAuthTokens()

Promise
Chrome 87+

```
chrome.identity.clearAllCachedAuthTokens(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

)
```

Gets an OAuth2 access token using the client ID and scopes specified in the [`oauth2` section of manifest.json](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/app_identity#update_manifest).

The Identity API caches access tokens in memory, so it's ok to call `getAuthToken` non-interactively any time a token is required. The token cache automatically handles expiration.

For a good user experience it is important interactive token requests are initiated by UI in your app explaining what the authorization is for. Failing to do this will cause your users to get authorization requests, or Chrome sign in screens if they are not signed in, with with no context. In particular, do not use `getAuthToken` interactively when your app is first launched.

Note: When called with a callback, instead of returning an object this function will return the two properties as separate arguments passed to the callback.

#### Parameters

* details

  [TokenDetails](#type-TokenDetails) optional

  Token options.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: [GetAuthTokenResult](#type-GetAuthTokenResult)) => void
  ```

  + result

    [GetAuthTokenResult](#type-GetAuthTokenResult)

    Chrome 105+
#### Returns

* Promise<[GetAuthTokenResult](#type-GetAuthTokenResult)>

  Chrome 105+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getProfileUserInfo()

Promise

```
chrome.identity.getProfileUserInfo(  
  details?: [ProfileDetails](#type-ProfileDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Retrieves email address and obfuscated gaia id of the user signed into a profile.

Requires the `identity.email` manifest permission. Otherwise, returns an empty result.

This API is different from identity.getAccounts in two ways. The information returned is available offline, and it only applies to the primary account for the profile.

#### Parameters

* details

  [ProfileDetails](#type-ProfileDetails) optional

  Chrome 84+

  Profile options.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (userInfo: [ProfileUserInfo](#type-ProfileUserInfo)) => void
  ```

  + userInfo

    [ProfileUserInfo](#type-ProfileUserInfo)
#### Returns

* Promise<[ProfileUserInfo](#type-ProfileUserInfo)>

  Chrome 106+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getRedirectURL()

```
chrome.identity.getRedirectURL(  
  path?: string,  
)
```

Generates a redirect URL to be used in `launchWebAuthFlow`.

The generated URLs match the pattern `https://<app-id>.chromiumapp.org/*`.

#### Parameters

* path

  string optional

  The path appended to the end of the generated URL.
#### Returns

* string
### launchWebAuthFlow()

Promise

```
chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow(  
  details: [WebAuthFlowDetails](#type-WebAuthFlowDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Starts an auth flow at the specified URL.

This method enables auth flows with non-Google identity providers by launching a web view and navigating it to the first URL in the provider's auth flow. When the provider redirects to a URL matching the pattern `https://<app-id>.chromiumapp.org/*`, the window will close, and the final redirect URL will be passed to the `callback` function.

For a good user experience it is important interactive auth flows are initiated by UI in your app explaining what the authorization is for. Failing to do this will cause your users to get authorization requests with no context. In particular, do not launch an interactive auth flow when your app is first launched.

#### Parameters

* details

  [WebAuthFlowDetails](#type-WebAuthFlowDetails)

  WebAuth flow options.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (responseUrl?: string) => void
  ```

  + responseUrl

    string optional
#### Returns

* Promise<string | undefined>

  Chrome 106+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### removeCachedAuthToken()

Promise

```
chrome.identity.removeCachedAuthToken(  
  details: [InvalidTokenDetails](#type-InvalidTokenDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Removes an OAuth2 access token from the Identity API's token cache.

If an access token is discovered to be invalid, it should be passed to removeCachedAuthToken to remove it from the cache. The app may then retrieve a fresh token with `getAuthToken`.

#### Parameters

* details

  [InvalidTokenDetails](#type-InvalidTokenDetails)

  Token information.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 106+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onSignInChanged

```
chrome.identity.onSignInChanged.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when signin state changes for an account on the user's profile.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (account: [AccountInfo](#type-AccountInfo), signedIn: boolean) => void
  ```

# chrome.input.ime

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.input.ime` API to implement a custom IME for Chrome OS. This allows your extension to handle keystrokes, set the composition, and manage the candidate window.

## Permissions

`input`  

You must declare the "input" permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use the input.ime API. For
example:

## Examples

The following code creates an IME that converts typed letters to upper case.

```
var context_id = -1;

chrome.input.ime.onFocus.addListener(function(context) {
  context_id = context.contextID;
});

chrome.input.ime.onKeyEvent.addListener(
  function(engineID, keyData) {
    if (keyData.type == "keydown" && keyData.key.match(/^[a-z]$/)) {

# chrome.offscreen  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/offscreen

# chrome.offscreen

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `offscreen` API to create and manage offscreen documents.

## Permissions

`offscreen`  

To use the Offscreen API, declare the `"offscreen"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "offscreen"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Availability

Chrome 109+
MV3+

## Concepts and usage

Service workers don't have DOM access, and many websites have content security policies that
limit the functionality of content scripts. The Offscreen API allows the extension to use DOM
APIs in a hidden document without interrupting the user experience by opening new windows or
tabs. The [`runtime`](/docs/extensions/reference/runtime) API is the only extensions API
supported by offscreen documents.

Pages loaded as offscreen documents are handled differently from other types of extension pages.
The extension's permissions carry over to offscreen documents, but with limits on extension API
access. For example, because the [`chrome.runtime`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime) API is the only
extensions API supported by offscreen documents, messaging must be handled
using members of that API.

The following are other ways offscreen documents behave differently from normal pages:

* An offscreen document's URL must be a static HTML file bundled with the extension.
* Offscreen documents can't be focused.
* An offscreen document is an instance of [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window), but the value of its `opener` property is always `null`.
* Though an extension package can contain multiple offscreen documents, an installed extension can only
  have one open at a time. If the extension is running
  in split mode with an active incognito profile, the normal and incognito profiles can each
  have one offscreen document.

Use [`chrome.offscreen.createDocument()`](#method-createDocument) and
[`chrome.offscreen.closeDocument()`](#method-closeDocument) to create and close an offscreen
document. `createDocument()` requires the document's `url`, a reason, and a justification:

```
chrome.offscreen.createDocument({
  url: 'off_screen.html',
  reasons: ['CLIPBOARD'],
  justification: 'reason for needing the document',
});

```
### Reasons

For a list of valid reasons, see the [Reasons](/docs/extensions/reference/api/offscreen#type-Reason) section. Reasons are set during
document creation to determine the document's lifespan. The `AUDIO_PLAYBACK` reason sets the
document to close after 30 seconds without audio playing. All other reasons don't set lifetime limits.

## Examples

### Maintain the lifecycle of an offscreen document

The following example shows how to ensure that an offscreen document exists. The
`setupOffscreenDocument()` function calls [`runtime.getContexts()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#method-getContexts) to find
an existing offscreen document, or creates the document if it doesn't already exist.

```
let creating; // A global promise to avoid concurrency issues
async function setupOffscreenDocument(path) {
  // Check all windows controlled by the service worker to see if one
  // of them is the offscreen document with the given path
  const offscreenUrl = chrome.runtime.getURL(path);
  const existingContexts = await chrome.runtime.getContexts({
    contextTypes: ['OFFSCREEN_DOCUMENT'],
    documentUrls: [offscreenUrl]
  });

  if (existingContexts.length > 0) {
    return;
  }

  // create offscreen document
  if (creating) {
    await creating;
  } else {
    creating = chrome.offscreen.createDocument({
      url: path,
      reasons: ['CLIPBOARD'],
      justification: 'reason for needing the document',
    });
    await creating;
    creating = null;
  }
}

```

Before sending a message to an offscreen document, call `setupOffscreenDocument()` to make sure
the document exists, as demonstrated in the following example.

```
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async () => {
  await setupOffscreenDocument('off_screen.html');

  // Send message to offscreen document
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
    type: '...',
    target: 'offscreen',
    data: '...'
  });
});

```

For complete examples, see the [offscreen-clipboard](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.offscreen-clipboard-write) and
[offscreen-dom](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.offscreen-dom) demos on GitHub.

### Before Chrome 116: check if an offscreen document is open

[`runtime.getContexts()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#method-getContexts) was added in Chrome 116. In earlier versions of
Chrome, use [`clients.matchAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Clients/matchAll)
to check for an existing offscreen document:

```
async function hasOffscreenDocument() {
  if ('getContexts' in chrome.runtime) {
    const contexts = await chrome.runtime.getContexts({
      contextTypes: ['OFFSCREEN_DOCUMENT'],
      documentUrls: [OFFSCREEN_DOCUMENT_PATH]
    });
    return Boolean(contexts.length);
  } else {
    const matchedClients = await clients.matchAll();
    return matchedClients.some(client => {
      return client.url.includes(chrome.runtime.id);
    });
  }
}

```

# chrome.omnibox  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/omnibox

# chrome.omnibox

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The omnibox API allows you to register a keyword with Google Chrome's address bar, which is also known as the omnibox.

When the user enters your extension's keyword, the user starts interacting solely with your
extension. Each keystroke is sent to your extension, and you can provide suggestions in response.

The suggestions can be richly formatted in a variety of ways. When the user accepts a suggestion,
your extension is notified and can take action.

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"omnibox"`  

You must include an `"omnibox.keyword"` field in the [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use the omnibox API. You
should also specify a 16 by 16-pixel icon, which will be displayed in the address bar when suggesting
that users enter keyword mode.

For example:

```
{
  "name": "Aaron's omnibox extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "omnibox": { "keyword" : "aaron" },
  "icons": {
    "16": "16-full-color.png"
  },
  "background": {
    "persistent": false,
    "scripts": ["background.js"]
  }
}

```
## Examples

To try this API, install the [omnibox API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/omnibox) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

### DefaultSuggestResult

A suggest result.

#### Properties

* description

  string

  The text that is displayed in the URL dropdown. Can contain XML-style markup for styling. The supported tags are 'url' (for a literal URL), 'match' (for highlighting text that matched what the user's query), and 'dim' (for dim helper text). The styles can be nested, eg. dimmed match.
### DescriptionStyleType

Chrome 44+

The style type.

#### Enum

"url"   

"match"   

"dim"   

### OnInputEnteredDisposition

Chrome 44+

The window disposition for the omnibox query. This is the recommended context to display results. For example, if the omnibox command is to navigate to a certain URL, a disposition of 'newForegroundTab' means the navigation should take place in a new selected tab.

#### Enum

"currentTab"   

"newForegroundTab"   

"newBackgroundTab"   

### SuggestResult

A suggest result.

#### Properties

* content

  string

  The text that is put into the URL bar, and that is sent to the extension when the user chooses this entry.
* deletable

  boolean optional

  Chrome 63+

  Whether the suggest result can be deleted by the user.
* description

  string

  The text that is displayed in the URL dropdown. Can contain XML-style markup for styling. The supported tags are 'url' (for a literal URL), 'match' (for highlighting text that matched what the user's query), and 'dim' (for dim helper text). The styles can be nested, eg. dimmed match. You must escape the five predefined entities to display them as text: stackoverflow.com/a/1091953/89484
## Methods

### setDefaultSuggestion()

Promise

```
chrome.omnibox.setDefaultSuggestion(  
  suggestion: [DefaultSuggestResult](#type-DefaultSuggestResult),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Sets the description and styling for the default suggestion. The default suggestion is the text that is displayed in the first suggestion row underneath the URL bar.

#### Parameters

# chrome.pageCapture  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/pageCapture

# chrome.pageCapture

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.pageCapture` API to save a tab as MHTML.

MHTML is a [standard format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2557) supported by most browsers. It encapsulates in a single file a page
and all its resources (CSS files, images..).

Note that for security reasons a MHTML file can only be loaded from the file system and that it can
only be loaded in the main frame.

## Permissions

`pageCapture`  

You must declare the "pageCapture" permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use the pageCapture
API. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "pageCapture"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Methods

### saveAsMHTML()

Promise

```
chrome.pageCapture.saveAsMHTML(  
  details: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Saves the content of the tab with given id as MHTML.

#### Parameters

* details

  object

  + tabId

    number

    The id of the tab to save as MHTML.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (mhtmlData?: Blob) => void
  ```

  + mhtmlData

    Blob optional

    The MHTML data as a Blob.
#### Returns

* Promise<Blob | undefined>

  Chrome 116+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

# chrome.permissions  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/permissions

# chrome.permissions

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.permissions` API to request [declared optional permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) at run time rather than install time, so users understand why the permissions are needed and grant only those that are necessary.

## Concepts and usage

Permission warnings exist to describe the capabilities granted by an API, but some of these warnings may not be obvious. The Permissions API allows developers to explain permission warnings and introduce new features gradually which gives users a risk-free introduction to the extension. This way, users can specify how much access they are willing to grant and which features they want to enable.

For example, the [optional permissions extension's](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/sample.optional_permissions) core functionality is overriding the new tab page. One feature is displaying the user's goal of the day. This feature only requires the [storage](/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage) permission, which does not include a warning. The extension has an additional feature, that users can enable by clicking the following button:

Displaying the user's top sites requires the [topSites](/docs/extensions/reference/api/topSites) permission, which has the following warning.

### Implement optional permissions

#### Step 1: Decide which permissions are required and which are optional

An extension can declare both required and optional permissions. In general, you should:

* Use required permissions when they are needed for your extension's basic functionality.
* Use optional permissions when they are needed for optional features in your extension.

Advantages of *required* permissions:

* **Fewer prompts:** An extension can prompt the user once to accept all permissions.
* **Simpler development:** Required permissions are guaranteed to be present.

Advantages of *optional* permissions:

* **Better security:** Extensions run with fewer permissions since users only enable permissions
  that are needed.
* **Better information for users:** An extension can explain why it needs a particular permission
  when the user enables the relevant feature.
* **Easier upgrades:** When you upgrade your extension, Chrome won't disable it for your users if
  the upgrade adds optional rather than required permissions.

#### Step 2: Declare optional permissions in the manifest

Declare optional permissions in your [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) with the `optional_permissions` key,
using the same format as the [permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) field:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "optional_permissions": ["tabs"],
  "optional_host_permissions": ["https://www.google.com/"],
  ...
}

```

If you want to request hosts that you only discover at runtime, include `"https://*/*"` in your extension's `optional_host_permissions` field. This lets you specify any origin in [`"Permissions.origins"`](#property-Permissions-origins) as long as it has a matching
scheme.

**Permissions that can *not* be specified as optional**

Most Chrome extension permissions can be specified as optional, with the following exceptions.

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"debugger"` | The [chrome.debugger](/docs/extensions/reference/api/debugger) API serves as an alternate transport for Chrome's [remote debugging protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). |
| `"declarativeNetRequest"` | Grants the extension access to the [chrome.declarativeNetRequest](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest) API. |
| `"devtools"` | Allows extension to expand [Chrome DevTools](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) functionality. |
| `"geolocation"` | Allows the extension to use the HTML5 [geolocation](https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/) API. |
| `"mdns"` | Grants the extension access to the [chrome.mdns](/docs/apps/reference/mdns) API. |
| `"proxy"` | Grants the extension access to the [chrome.proxy](/docs/extensions/reference/api/proxy) API to manage Chrome's proxy settings. |
| `"tts"` | The [chrome.tts](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts) API plays synthesized text-to-speech (TTS). |
| `"ttsEngine"` | The [chrome.ttsEngine](/docs/extensions/reference/api/ttsEngine) API implements a text-to-speech (TTS) engine using an extension. |
| `"wallpaper"` | **ChromeOS only**. Use the [chrome.wallpaper](/docs/extensions/reference/api/wallpaper) API change the ChromeOS wallpaper. |

View [Declare Permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) for further information on available permissions and
their warnings.

#### Step 3: Request optional permissions

Request the permissions from within a user gesture using `permissions.request()`:

```
document.querySelector('#my-button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // Permissions must be requested from inside a user gesture, like a button's
  // click handler.
  chrome.permissions.request({
    permissions: ['tabs'],
    origins: ['https://www.google.com/']
  }, (granted) => {
    // The callback argument will be true if the user granted the permissions.
    if (granted) {
      doSomething();
    } else {
      doSomethingElse();
    }
  });
});

```

Chrome prompts the user if adding the permissions results in different [warning messages](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) than
the user has already seen and accepted. For example, the previous code might result in a prompt like
this:

#### Step 4: Check the extension's current permissions

To check whether your extension has a specific permission or set of permissions, use
`permission.contains()`:

```
chrome.permissions.contains({
  permissions: ['tabs'],
  origins: ['https://www.google.com/']
}, (result) => {
  if (result) {
    // The extension has the permissions.
  } else {
    // The extension doesn't have the permissions.
  }
});

```
#### Step 5: Remove the permissions

You should remove permissions when you no longer need them. After a permission has been removed,
calling `permissions.request()` usually adds the permission back without prompting the user.

```
chrome.permissions.remove({
  permissions: ['tabs'],
  origins: ['https://www.google.com/']
}, (removed) => {
  if (removed) {
    // The permissions have been removed.
  } else {
    // The permissions have not been removed (e.g., you tried to remove
    // required permissions).
  }
});

```
## Types

### Permissions

#### Properties

* origins

  string[] optional

  The list of host permissions, including those specified in the `optional_permissions` or `permissions` keys in the manifest, and those associated with [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts).
* permissions

  string[] optional

  List of named permissions (does not include hosts or origins).
## Methods

### addHostAccessRequest()

Promise
PendingMV3+

```
chrome.permissions.addHostAccessRequest(  
  request: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Adds a host access request. Request will only be signaled to the user if extension can be granted access to the host in the request. Request will be reset on cross-origin navigation. When accepted, grants persistent access to the site’s top origin

#### Parameters

* request

  object

  + documentId

    string optional

    The id of a document where host access requests can be shown. Must be the top-level document within a tab. If provided, the request is shown on the tab of the specified document and is removed when the document navigates to a new origin. Adding a new request will override any existent request for `tabId`. This or `tabId` must be specified.
  + pattern

    string optional

    The URL pattern where host access requests can be shown. If provided, host access requests will only be shown on URLs that match this pattern.
  + tabId

    number optional

    The id of the tab where host access requests can be shown. If provided, the request is shown on the specified tab and is removed when the tab navigates to a new origin. Adding a new request will override an existent request for `documentId`. This or `documentId` must be specified.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### contains()

Promise

```
chrome.permissions.contains(  
  permissions: [Permissions](#type-Permissions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

These permissions must either be defined in the `optional_permissions` field of the manifest or be required permissions that were withheld by the user. Paths on origin patterns will be ignored. You can request subsets of optional origin permissions; for example, if you specify `*://*\/*` in the `optional_permissions` section of the manifest, you can request `http://example.com/`. If there are any problems requesting the permissions, [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime/#property-lastError) will be set.

#### Parameters

* permissions

  [Permissions](#type-Permissions)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (granted: boolean) => void
  ```

  + granted

    boolean

    True if the user granted the specified permissions.
#### Returns

* Promise<boolean>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

# chrome.platformKeys  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/platformKeys

# chrome.platformKeys

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.platformKeys` API to access client certificates managed by the platform. If the user or policy grants the permission, an extension can use such a certficate in its custom authentication protocol. E.g. this allows usage of platform managed certificates in third party VPNs (see [chrome.vpnProvider](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/vpnProvider/)).

## Permissions

`platformKeys`  
## Availability

Chrome 45+
ChromeOS only

## Types

### ClientCertificateRequest

#### Properties

* certificateAuthorities

  ArrayBuffer[]

  List of distinguished names of certificate authorities allowed by the server. Each entry must be a DER-encoded X.509 DistinguishedName.
* certificateTypes

  [ClientCertificateType](#type-ClientCertificateType)[]

  This field is a list of the types of certificates requested, sorted in order of the server's preference. Only certificates of a type contained in this list will be retrieved. If `certificateTypes` is the empty list, however, certificates of any type will be returned.
### ClientCertificateType

#### Enum

"rsaSign"   

"ecdsaSign"   

### Match

#### Properties

* certificate

  ArrayBuffer

  The DER encoding of a X.509 certificate.
* keyAlgorithm

  object

  The [KeyAlgorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#key-algorithm-dictionary) of the certified key. This contains algorithm parameters that are inherent to the key of the certificate (e.g. the key length). Other parameters like the hash function used by the sign function are not included.
### SelectDetails

#### Properties

* clientCerts

  ArrayBuffer[] optional

  If given, the `selectClientCertificates` operates on this list. Otherwise, obtains the list of all certificates from the platform's certificate stores that are available to this extensions. Entries that the extension doesn't have permission for or which doesn't match the request, are removed.
* interactive

  boolean

  If true, the filtered list is presented to the user to manually select a certificate and thereby granting the extension access to the certificate(s) and key(s). Only the selected certificate(s) will be returned. If is false, the list is reduced to all certificates that the extension has been granted access to (automatically or manually).
* request

  [ClientCertificateRequest](#type-ClientCertificateRequest)

  Only certificates that match this request will be returned.
### VerificationDetails

#### Properties

* hostname

  string

  The hostname of the server to verify the certificate for, e.g. the server that presented the `serverCertificateChain`.
* serverCertificateChain

  ArrayBuffer[]

  Each chain entry must be the DER encoding of a X.509 certificate, the first entry must be the server certificate and each entry must certify the entry preceding it.
### VerificationResult

#### Properties

* debug\_errors

  string[]

  If the trust verification failed, this array contains the errors reported by the underlying network layer. Otherwise, this array is empty.

  **Note:** This list is meant for debugging only and may not contain all relevant errors. The errors returned may change in future revisions of this API, and are not guaranteed to be forwards or backwards compatible.
* trusted

  boolean

  The result of the trust verification: true if trust for the given verification details could be established and false if trust is rejected for any reason.
## Methods

### getKeyPair()

```
chrome.platformKeys.getKeyPair(  
  certificate: ArrayBuffer,  
  parameters: object,  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Passes the key pair of `certificate` for usage with [`platformKeys.subtleCrypto`](#method-subtleCrypto) to `callback`.

#### Parameters

* certificate

  ArrayBuffer

  The certificate of a [`Match`](#type-Match) returned by [`selectClientCertificates`](#method-selectClientCertificates).
* parameters

  object

  Determines signature/hash algorithm parameters additionally to the parameters fixed by the key itself. The same parameters are accepted as by WebCrypto's [importKey](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#SubtleCrypto-method-importKey) function, e.g. `RsaHashedImportParams` for a RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 key and `EcKeyImportParams` for EC key. Additionally for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 keys, hashing algorithm name parameter can be specified with one of the following values: "none", "SHA-1", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", or "SHA-512", e.g. `{"hash": { "name": "none" } }`. The sign function will then apply PKCS#1 v1.5 padding but not hash the given data.

  Currently, this method only supports the "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5" and "ECDSA" algorithms.
* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (publicKey: object, privateKey?: object) => void
  ```

  + publicKey

    object
  + privateKey

    object optional

    Might be `null` if this extension does not have access to it.
### getKeyPairBySpki()

Chrome 85+

```
chrome.platformKeys.getKeyPairBySpki(  
  publicKeySpkiDer: ArrayBuffer,  
  parameters: object,  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Passes the key pair identified by `publicKeySpkiDer` for usage with [`platformKeys.subtleCrypto`](#method-subtleCrypto) to `callback`.

#### Parameters

* publicKeySpkiDer

  ArrayBuffer

  A DER-encoded X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo, obtained e.g. by calling WebCrypto's exportKey function with format="spki".
* parameters

  object

  Provides signature and hash algorithm parameters, in addition to those fixed by the key itself. The same parameters are accepted as by WebCrypto's [importKey](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#SubtleCrypto-method-importKey) function, e.g. `RsaHashedImportParams` for a RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 key. For RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5 keys, we need to also pass a "hash" parameter `{ "hash": { "name": string } }`. The "hash" parameter represents the name of the hashing algorithm to be used in the digest operation before a sign. It is possible to pass "none" as the hash name, in which case the sign function will apply PKCS#1 v1.5 padding and but not hash the given data.

  Currently, this method supports the "ECDSA" algorithm with named-curve P-256 and "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1\_5" algorithm with one of the hashing algorithms "none", "SHA-1", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", and "SHA-512".
* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (publicKey: object, privateKey?: object) => void
  ```

  + publicKey

    object
  + privateKey

    object optional

    Might be `null` if this extension does not have access to it.
### selectClientCertificates()

Promise

```
chrome.platformKeys.selectClientCertificates(  
  details: [SelectDetails](#type-SelectDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

This method filters from a list of client certificates the ones that are known to the platform, match `request` and for which the extension has permission to access the certificate and its private key. If `interactive` is true, the user is presented a dialog where they can select from matching certificates and grant the extension access to the certificate. The selected/filtered client certificates will be passed to `callback`.

#### Parameters

* details

  [SelectDetails](#type-SelectDetails)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (matches: [Match](#type-Match)[]) => void
  ```

  + matches

    [Match](#type-Match)[]

    The list of certificates that match the request, that the extension has permission for and, if `interactive` is true, that were selected by the user.
#### Returns

* Promise<[Match](#type-Match)[]>

  Chrome 121+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### subtleCrypto()

```
chrome.platformKeys.subtleCrypto()
```

An implementation of WebCrypto's [SubtleCrypto](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#subtlecrypto-interface) that allows crypto operations on keys of client certificates that are available to this extension.

#### Returns

* object | undefined
### verifyTLSServerCertificate()

Promise

```
chrome.platformKeys.verifyTLSServerCertificate(  
  details: [VerificationDetails](#type-VerificationDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Checks whether `details.serverCertificateChain` can be trusted for `details.hostname` according to the trust settings of the platform. Note: The actual behavior of the trust verification is not fully specified and might change in the future. The API implementation verifies certificate expiration, validates the certification path and checks trust by a known CA. The implementation is supposed to respect the EKU serverAuth and to support subject alternative names.

#### Parameters

* details

  [VerificationDetails](#type-VerificationDetails)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: [VerificationResult](#type-VerificationResult)) => void
  ```

  + result

    [VerificationResult](#type-VerificationResult)
#### Returns

* Promise<[VerificationResult](#type-VerificationResult)>

  Chrome 121+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

# chrome.power  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/power

# chrome.power

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.power` API to override the system's power management features.

## Permissions

`power`  
## Concepts and usage

By default, operating systems dim the screen when users are inactive and eventually suspend the
system. With the power API, an app or extension can keep the system awake.

Using this API, you can specify the [Level](#type-Level) to which power management is disabled. The `"system"`
level keeps the system active, but allows the screen to be dimmed or turned off. For example, a
communication app can continue to receive messages while the screen is off. The `"display"` level
keeps the screen and system active. E-book and presentation apps, for example, can keep the screen
and system active while users read.

When a user has more than one app or extension active, each with its own power level, the
highest-precedence level takes effect; `"display"` always takes precedence over `"system"`. For
example, if app A asks for `"system"` power management, and app B asks for `"display"`, `"display"`
is used until app B is unloaded or releases its request. If app A is still active, `"system"` is
then used.

## Types

### Level

#### Enum

"system"   
 Prevents the system from sleeping in response to user inactivity.

"display"   
 Prevents the display from being turned off or dimmed, or the system from sleeping in response to user inactivity.

## Methods

### releaseKeepAwake()

```
chrome.power.releaseKeepAwake()
```

Releases a request previously made via requestKeepAwake().

### reportActivity()

Promise
Chrome 113+
ChromeOS only

```
chrome.power.reportActivity(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Reports a user activity in order to awake the screen from a dimmed or turned off state or from a screensaver. Exits the screensaver if it is currently active.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### requestKeepAwake()

```
chrome.power.requestKeepAwake(  
  level: [Level](#type-Level),  
)
```

Requests that power management be temporarily disabled. `level` describes the degree to which power management should be disabled. If a request previously made by the same app is still active, it will be replaced by the new request.

#### Parameters

* level

  [Level](#type-Level)

# chrome.printing  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/printing

# chrome.printing

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.printing` API to send print jobs to printers installed on Chromebook.

## Permissions

`printing`  
## Availability

Chrome 81+
ChromeOS only

All `chrome.printing` methods and events require you to declare the `"printing"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "printing"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Examples

The examples below demonstrate using each of the methods in the printing namespace. This code is copied from or based on the [api-samples/printing](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/printing) in the extensions-samples Github repo.

### cancelJob()

This example uses the `onJobStatusChanged` handler to hide a 'cancel' button when the `jobStatus` is neither `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`. Note that on some networks or when a Chromebook is connected directly to the printer, these states may pass too quickly for the cancel button to be visible long enough to be called. This is greatly simplified printing example.

```
chrome.printing.onJobStatusChanged.addListener((jobId, status) => {
  const cancelButton = document.getElementById("cancelButton");
  cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    chrome.printing.cancelJob(jobId).then((response) => {
      if (response !== undefined) {
        console.log(response.status);
      }
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
        console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
      }
    });
  });
  if (status !== "PENDING" && status !== "IN_PROGRESS") {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'hidden';
  } else {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'visible';
  }
}

```
### getPrinters() and getPrinterInfo()

A single example is used for these functions because getting printer information requires a printer ID, which is retrieved by calling `getPrinters()`. This example logs the name and description of the default printer to the console. This is a simplified version of the printing example.

```
​​const printers = await chrome.printing.getPrinters();
const defaultPrinter = printers.find((printer) => {
  const printerInfo = await chrome.printing.getPrinterInfo(printer.id);
  return printerInfo.isDefault;
}
console.log(`Default printer: ${defaultPrinter.name}.\n\t${defaultPrinter.description}`);

```
### submitJob()

The `submitJob()` method requires three things.

* A `ticket` structure specifying which capabilities of the printer are to be used. If the user needs to select from available capabilities, you can retrieve them for a specific printer using `getPrinterInfo()`.
* A `SubmitJobRequest` structure, which specifies the printer to use, and the file or date to print. This structure contains a reference to the `ticket` structure.
* A blob of the file or data to print.

Calling `submitJob()` triggers a dialog box asking the user to confirm printing. Use the [`PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist`](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist%22) to bypass confirmation.

This is a simplified version of the printing example. Notice that the `ticket` is attached to the `SubmitJobRequest` structure (line 8) and that the data to print is converted to a blob (line 10). Getting the ID of the printer (line 1) is more complicated [in the sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/printing) than is shown here.

```
const defaultPrinter = getDefaultPrinter();
const ticket = getPrinterTicket(defaultPrinter);
const arrayBuffer = getPrintData();
const submitJobRequest = {
  job: {
    printerId: defaultPrinter,
    title: 'test job',
    ticket: ticket,
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    document: new Blob([new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)], {
      type: 'application/pdf'
    });
  }
};

chrome.printing.submitJob(submitJobRequest, (response) => {
  if (response !== undefined) {
    console.log(response.status);
  }
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
    console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  }
});

```
### Roll printing

This example shows how to build a printer ticket for continuous (or roll) printing, which is often used with receipt printing. The `submitJobRequest` object for roll printing is the same as that shown for the [`submitJob()`](#submitjob) example.

If you need to change the default value for paper cutting, use the `vendor_ticket_item` key. (The default varies from printer to printer.) To change the value, provide an array with one member: an object whose `id` is `'finishings'`. The value can either be `'trim'` for printers that cut the roll at the end of printing or `'none'` for printers that require the print job to be torn off.

```
const ticket = {
  version: '1.0',
  print: {
    vendor_ticket_item: [{id: 'finishings', value: 'trim'}],
    color: {type: 'STANDARD_MONOCHROME'},
    duplex: {type: 'NO_DUPLEX'},
    page_orientation: {type: 'PORTRAIT'},
    copies: {copies: 1},
    dpi: {horizontal_dpi: 300, vertical_dpi: 300},
    media_size: {
      width_microns: 72320,
      height_microns: 100000
    },
    collate: {collate: false}
  }
};

```

Some printers do not support the `"finishings"` option. To determine if your printer does, call [`getPrinterInfo()`](#method-getPrinterInfo) and look for a `"display_name"` of `"finishings/11"`.

```
"vendor_capability": [
  {

The values in a ticket's `media_size` key are specific to each printer. To select an appropriate size call [`getPrinterInfo()`](#method-getPrinterInfo). The returned [`GetPrinterResponse`](#type-GetPrinterInfoResponse) contains an array of supported media sizes at `"media_size"."option"`. Choose an option whose `"is_continuous_feed"` value is true. Use its height and width values for the ticket.

```
"media_size": {
  "option": [
  {
    "custom_display_name": "",
    "is_continuous_feed": true,
    "max_height_microns": 2000000,

# chrome.privacy  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/privacy

# chrome.privacy

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.privacy` API to control usage of the features in Chrome that can affect a user's privacy. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/types/#ChromeSetting) for getting and setting Chrome's configuration.

## Permissions

`privacy`  

You must declare the "privacy" permission in your extension's [manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use the API. For
example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "privacy"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

Reading the current value of a Chrome setting is straightforward. You'll first need to find the
property you're interested in, then you'll call `get()` on that object in order to retrieve its
current value and your extension's level of control. For example, to determine if Chrome's credit card autofill
feature is enabled, you'd write:

```
chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.value) {
    console.log('Autofill is on!');
  } else {
    console.log('Autofill is off!');
  }
});

```

Changing the value of a setting is a little bit more complex, because you first must verify
that your extension can control the setting. The user won't see any change to their settings if your
extension toggles a setting that is either locked to a specific value by enterprise policies
(`levelOfControl` will be set to "not\_controllable"), or if another extension is controlling the
value (`levelOfControl` will be set to "controlled\_by\_other\_extensions"). The `set()` call will
succeed, but the setting will be immediately overridden. As this might be confusing, it is advisable
to warn the user when the settings they've chosen aren't practically applied.

This means that you ought to use the `get()` method to determine your level of access, and then only
call `set()` if your extension can grab control over the setting (in fact if your extension can't
control the setting it's probably a good idea to visually disable the feature to reduce user
confusion):

```
chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.levelOfControl === 'controllable_by_this_extension') {
    chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.set({ value: true }, function() {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError === undefined) {
        console.log("Hooray, it worked!");
      } else {
        console.log("Sadness!", chrome.runtime.lastError);
      }
    });
  }
});

```

If you're interested in changes to a setting's value, add a listener to its `onChange` event. Among
other uses, this will allow you to warn the user if a more recently installed extension grabs
control of a setting, or if enterprise policy overrides your control. To listen for changes to
credit card autofill status, for example, the following code would suffice:

```
chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.onChange.addListener(
  function (details) {
    // The new value is stored in `details.value`, the new level of control
    // in `details.levelOfControl`, and `details.incognitoSpecific` will be
    // `true` if the value is specific to Incognito mode.
  }
);

```
## Examples

To try this API, install the [privacy API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/privacy) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

# chrome.proxy  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/proxy

# chrome.proxy

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.proxy` API to manage Chrome's proxy settings. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/types#type-ChromeSetting) for getting and setting the proxy configuration.

## Permissions

`proxy`  

You must declare the "proxy" permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use the proxy settings
API. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "proxy"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

Proxy settings are defined in a [`proxy.ProxyConfig`](#type-ProxyConfig) object. Depending on Chrome's proxy settings,
the settings may contain [`proxy.ProxyRules`](#type-ProxyRules) or a [`proxy.PacScript`](#type-PacScript).

### Proxy modes

A ProxyConfig object's `mode` attribute determines the overall behavior of Chrome with regards to
proxy usage. It can take the following values:

`direct`
In `direct` mode all connections are created directly, without any proxy involved. This mode allows
no further parameters in the `ProxyConfig` object.
`auto_detect`
In `auto_detect` mode the proxy configuration is determined by a PAC script that can be downloaded
at <http://wpad/wpad.dat>. This mode allows no further parameters in the `ProxyConfig` object.
`pac_script`
In `pac_script` mode the proxy configuration is determined by a PAC script that is either retrieved
from the URL specified in the [`proxy.PacScript`](#type-PacScript) object or taken literally from the `data` element
specified in the [`proxy.PacScript`](#type-PacScript) object. Besides this, this mode allows no further parameters
in the `ProxyConfig` object.
`fixed_servers`
In `fixed_servers` mode the proxy configuration is codified in a [`proxy.ProxyRules`](#type-ProxyRules) object. Its
structure is described in [Proxy rules](#proxy_rules). Besides this, the `fixed_servers` mode allows no further
parameters in the `ProxyConfig` object.
`system`
In `system` mode the proxy configuration is taken from the operating system. This mode allows no
further parameters in the `ProxyConfig` object. Note that the `system` mode is different from
setting no proxy configuration. In the latter case, Chrome falls back to the system settings only if
no command-line options influence the proxy configuration.
### Proxy rules

The [`proxy.ProxyRules`](#type-ProxyRules) object can contain either a `singleProxy` attribute or a subset of
`proxyForHttp`, `proxyForHttps`, `proxyForFtp`, and `fallbackProxy`.

In the first case, HTTP, HTTPS and FTP traffic is proxied through the specified proxy server. Other
traffic is sent directly. In the latter case the behavior is slightly more subtle: If a proxy server
is configured for the HTTP, HTTPS or FTP protocol, the respective traffic is proxied through the
specified server. If no such proxy server is specified or traffic uses a different protocol than
HTTP, HTTPS or FTP, the `fallbackProxy` is used. If no `fallbackProxy` is specified, traffic is sent
directly without a proxy server.

### Proxy server objects

A proxy server is configured in a [`proxy.ProxyServer`](#type-ProxyServer) object. The connection to the proxy server
(defined by the `host` attribute) uses the protocol defined in the `scheme` attribute. If no
`scheme` is specified, the proxy connection defaults to `http`.

If no `port` is defined in a [`proxy.ProxyServer`](#type-ProxyServer) object, the port is derived from the scheme.
The default ports are:

| Scheme | Port |
| --- | --- |
| http | 80 |
| https | 443 |
| socks4 | 1080 |
| socks5 | 1080 |

### Bypass list

Individual servers may be excluded from being proxied with the `bypassList`. This list may contain
the following entries:

`[SCHEME://]HOST_PATTERN[:PORT]`

Match all hostnames that match the pattern `HOST_PATTERN`. A leading `"."` is interpreted as a
`"*."`.

Examples: `"foobar.com", "*foobar.com", "*.foobar.com", "*foobar.com:99", "https://x.*.y.com:99"`.

| Pattern | Matches | Does not match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `".foobar.com"` | `"www.foobar.com"` | `"foobar.com"` |
| `"*.foobar.com"` | `"www.foobar.com"` | `"foobar.com"` |
| `"foobar.com"` | `"foobar.com"` | `"www.foobar.com"` |
| `"*foobar.com"` | `"foobar.com"`, `"www.foobar.com"`, `"foofoobar.com"` |  |

`[SCHEME://]IP_LITERAL[:PORT]`

Match URLs that are IP address literals. Conceptually this is the similar to the first case, but
with special cases to handle IP literal canonicalization. For example, matching on "[0:0:0::1]"
is the same as matching on "[::1]" because the IPv6 canonicalization is done internally.

Examples: `127.0.1`, `[0:0::1]`, `[::1]:80`, `https://[::1]:443`

`IP_LITERAL/PREFIX_LENGTH_IN_BITS`

Match any URL containing an IP literal (`IP_LITERAL`) within the given
range. The IP range (`PREFIX_LENGTH_IN_BITS`) is specified using [CIDR
notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation).

Match any URL containing an IP literal within the given range. The IP range is specified using CIDR
notation.
Examples: `"192.168.1.1/16", "fefe:13::abc/33"`

`<local>`

The literal string `<local>` matches simple hostnames. A simple hostname is one that contains no
dots and is not an IP literal. For instance `example` and `localhost` are simple hostnames,
whereas `example.com`, `example.`, and `[::1]` are not.

Example: `"<local>"`

## Examples

The following code sets a SOCKS 5 proxy for HTTP connections to all servers but foobar.com and uses
direct connections for all other protocols. The settings apply to regular and incognito windows, as
incognito windows inherit settings from regular windows. See also the [Types API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/types#type-ChromeSetting)
documentation.

```
var config = {
  mode: "fixed_servers",
  rules: {
    proxyForHttp: {
      scheme: "socks5",
      host: "1.2.3.4"
    },
    bypassList: ["foobar.com"]
  }
};
chrome.proxy.settings.set(
  {value: config, scope: 'regular'},
  function() {}
);

```

The following code sets a custom PAC script.

```
var config = {
  mode: "pac_script",
  pacScript: {
    data: "function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {\n" +
          "  if (host == 'foobar.com')\n" +
          "    return 'PROXY blackhole:80';\n" +
          "  return 'DIRECT';\n" +
          "}"
  }
};
chrome.proxy.settings.set(
  {value: config, scope: 'regular'},
  function() {}
);

```

The next snippet queries the current effective proxy settings. The effective proxy settings can be
determined by another extension or by a policy. See the [Types API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/types#type-ChromeSetting) documentation for details.

```
chrome.proxy.settings.get(
  {'incognito': false},
  function(config) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(config));
  }
);

```

Note that the `value` object passed to `set()` is not identical to the `value` object passed to
callback function of `get()`. The latter will contain a `rules.proxyForHttp.port` element.

## Description

Use the `chrome.readingList` API to read from and modify the items in the [Reading List](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019).

## Permissions

`readingList`  

To use the Reading List API, add the `"readingList"` permission in the extension [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) file:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My reading list extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "readingList"
  ]
}

```
## Availability

Chrome 120+
MV3+

Chrome features a reading list located on the side panel. It lets users save web pages to read later or when offline.
Use the Reading List API to retrieve existing items and add or remove items from the list.

## Concepts and usage

### Item ordering

Items in the reading list are not in any guaranteed order.

### Item uniqueness

Items are keyed by URL. This includes the hash and query string.

## Use cases

The following sections demonstrate some common use cases for the Reading List API. See [Extension samples](#examples) for complete extension examples.

### Add an item

To add an item to the reading list, use [`chrome.readingList.addEntry()`](#method-addEntry):

```
chrome.readingList.addEntry({
  title: "New to the web platform in September | web.dev",
  url: "https://developer.chrome.com/",
  hasBeenRead: false
});

```
### Display items

To display items from the reading list, use the [`chrome.readingList.query()`](#method-query) method to retrieve them.
method.

```
const items = await chrome.readingList.query({});

for (const item of items) {
  // Do something do display the item
}

```
### Mark an item as read

You can use [`chrome.readingList.updateEntry()`](#method-updateEntry) to update the title, URL, and read status. The following code marks an item as read:

```
chrome.readingList.updateEntry({
  url: "https://developer.chrome.com/",
  hasBeenRead: true
});

```
### Remove an item

To remove an item, use [`chrome.readingList.removeEntry()`](#method-removeEntry):

# chrome.runtime  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime

# chrome.runtime

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.runtime` API to retrieve the service worker, return details about the manifest, and listen for and respond to events in the extension lifecycle. You can also use this API to convert the relative path of URLs to fully-qualified URLs.

Most members of this API do **not** require any permissions. This permission is needed for [`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative), [`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage) and [`onNativeConnect`](#event-onConnectNative).

The following example shows how to declare the `"nativeMessaging"` permission in the manifest:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "nativeMessaging"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

The Runtime API provides methods to support a number of areas that your extensions
can use:

Message passing
Your extension can communicate with different contexts within your extension and also with other extensions using these methods and events:
[`connect()`](#method-connect),
[`onConnect`](#event-onConnect),
[`onConnectExternal`](#event-onConnectExternal),
[`sendMessage()`](#method-sendMessage),
[`onMessage`](#event-onMessage) and
[`onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal).
In addition, your extension can pass messages to native applications on the user's device using
[`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative) and
[`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage).

Accessing extension and platform metadata
These methods let you retrieve several specific pieces of metadata about the extension and the
platform. Methods in this category include
[`getManifest()`](#method-getManifest), and
[`getPlatformInfo()`](#method-getPlatformInfo).
Managing extension lifecycle and options
These properties let you perform some meta-operations on the extension, and display the options page.
Methods and events in this category include
[`onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled),
[`onStartup`](#event-onStartup),
[`openOptionsPage()`](#method-openOptionsPage),
[`reload()`](#method-reload),
[`requestUpdateCheck()`](#method-requestUpdateCheck), and
[`setUninstallURL()`](#method-setUninstallURL).
Helper utilities
These methods provide utility such as the conversion of internal resource representations to
external formats. Methods in this category include
[`getURL()`](#method-getURL).
Kiosk mode utilities
These methods are available only on ChromeOS, and exist mainly to support kiosk implementations.
Methods in this category include
[`restart()`](#method-restart) and
[`restartAfterDelay()``](#method-restartAfterDelay).
### Unpacked extension behavior

When an [unpacked](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) extension is [reloaded](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#reload), this is treated as an update. This means that the
[`chrome.runtime.onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled) event will fire with the `"update"` reason. This
includes when the extension is reloaded with [`chrome.runtime.reload()`](#method-reload).

## Use cases

### Add an image to a web page

For a web page to access an asset hosted on another domain, it must specify the resource's full URL
(e.g. `<img src="https://example.com/logo.png">`). The same is true to include an extension asset on
a web page. The two differences are that the extension's assets must be exposed as [web
accessible resources](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) and that typically content scripts are responsible for injecting
extension assets.

In this example, the extension will add `logo.png` to the page that the [content
script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts) is being [injected](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality) into by using `runtime.getURL()` to create a
fully-qualified URL. But first, the asset must be declared as a web accessible resource in the manifest.

manifest.json:

```
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [ "logo.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://*/*" ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

content.js:

```
{ // Block used to avoid setting global variables
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = chrome.runtime.getURL('logo.png');
  document.body.append(img);
}

```
### Send data from a content script to the service worker

Its common for an extension's content scripts to need data managed by another part of the extension,
like the service worker. Much like two browser windows opened to the same web page, these
two contexts cannot directly access each other's values. Instead, the extension can use [message
passing](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging) to coordinate across these different contexts.

In this example, the content script needs some data from the extension's service worker to
initialize its UI. To get this data, it passes the developer-defined `get-user-data` message
to the service worker, and it responds with a copy of the user's information.

content.js:

```
// 1. Send a message to the service worker requesting the user's data
chrome.runtime.sendMessage('get-user-data', (response) => {
  // 3. Got an asynchronous response with the data from the service worker
  console.log('received user data', response);
  initializeUI(response);
});

```

service-worker.js:

```
// Example of a simple user data object
const user = {
  username: 'demo-user'
};

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  // 2. A page requested user data, respond with a copy of `user`
  if (message === 'get-user-data') {
    sendResponse(user);
  }
});

```
### Gather feedback on uninstall

Many extensions use post-uninstall surveys to understand how the extension could better serve its
users and improve retention. The following example shows how to add this functionality.

background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(details => {
  if (details.reason === chrome.runtime.OnInstalledReason.INSTALL) {
    chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL('https://example.com/extension-survey');
  }
});

```
## Examples

See the [Manifest V3 - Web Accessible Resources demo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/web-accessible-resources) for more Runtime API examples.

  string

  The name of the port, as specified in the call to [`runtime.connect`](#method-connect).
* onDisconnect

  Event<functionvoidvoid>

  Fired when the port is disconnected from the other end(s). [`runtime.lastError`](#property-lastError) may be set if the port was disconnected by an error. If the port is closed via [disconnect](#method-Port-disconnect), then this event is *only* fired on the other end. This event is fired at most once (see also [Port lifetime](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/messaging#port-lifetime)).

  The `onDisconnect.addListener` function looks like:
  ```
  (callback: function) => {...}
  ```

  + callback

    function

    The `callback` parameter looks like:
    ```
    (port: [Port](#type-Port)) => void
    ```

    - port

      [Port](#type-Port)
* onMessage

  Event<functionvoidvoid>

  This event is fired when [postMessage](#method-Port-postMessage) is called by the other end of the port.

  The `onMessage.addListener` function looks like:
  ```
  (callback: function) => {...}
  ```

  + callback

    function

If an error is produced, but `runtime.lastError` is not accessed within the callback, a message is logged to the console listing the API function that produced the error. API functions that return promises do not set this property.

#### Type

object

#### Properties

* message

  string optional

  Details about the error which occurred.
## Methods

### connect()

```
chrome.runtime.connect(  
  extensionId?: string,  
  connectInfo?: object,  
)
```

Attempts to connect listeners within an extension (such as the background page), or other extensions/apps. This is useful for content scripts connecting to their extension processes, inter-app/extension communication, and [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable). Note that this does not connect to any listeners in a content script. Extensions may connect to content scripts embedded in tabs via [`tabs.connect`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-connect).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to connect to. If omitted, a connection will be attempted with your own extension. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/externally-connectable).
* connectInfo

  object optional

  + includeTlsChannelId

    boolean optional

    Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onConnectExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.
  + name

    string optional

    Will be passed into onConnect for processes that are listening for the connection event.
#### Returns

* [Port](#type-Port)

  Port through which messages can be sent and received. The port's [onDisconnect](#type-Port) event is fired if the extension does not exist.
### connectNative()

```
chrome.runtime.connectNative(  
  application: string,  
)
```

Connects to a native application in the host machine. This method requires the `"nativeMessaging"` permission. See [Native Messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) for more information.

#### Parameters

* application

  string

  The name of the registered application to connect to.
#### Returns

* [Port](#type-Port)

  Port through which messages can be sent and received with the application
### getBackgroundPage()

Promise
Foreground only
Deprecated
```
chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Background pages do not exist in MV3 extensions.

Retrieves the JavaScript 'window' object for the background page running inside the current extension/app. If the background page is an event page, the system will ensure it is loaded before calling the callback. If there is no background page, an error is set.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (backgroundPage?: Window) => void
  ```

  + backgroundPage

    Window optional

    The JavaScript 'window' object for the background page.
#### Returns

* Promise<Window | undefined>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getContexts()

Promise
Chrome 116+
MV3+

```
chrome.runtime.getContexts(  
  filter: [ContextFilter](#type-ContextFilter),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Fetches information about active contexts associated with this extension

#### Parameters

  ```
  (contexts: [ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]) => void
  ```

  + contexts

    [ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]

    The matching contexts, if any.
#### Returns

* Promise<[ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getManifest()

```
chrome.runtime.getManifest()
```

Returns details about the app or extension from the manifest. The object returned is a serialization of the full [manifest file](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

#### Returns

* object

  The manifest details.
### getPackageDirectoryEntry()

Promise
Foreground only

```
chrome.runtime.getPackageDirectoryEntry(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Returns a DirectoryEntry for the package directory.

#### Parameters

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (directoryEntry: DirectoryEntry) => void
  ```

  + directoryEntry

    DirectoryEntry
#### Returns

* Promise<DirectoryEntry>

  Chrome 122+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getPlatformInfo()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.getPlatformInfo(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Returns information about the current platform.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (platformInfo: [PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)) => void
  ```

  + platformInfo

    [PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)
#### Returns

* Promise<[PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getURL()

```
chrome.runtime.getURL(  
  path: string,  
)
```

Converts a relative path within an app/extension install directory to a fully-qualified URL.

#### Parameters

* path

  string

  A path to a resource within an app/extension expressed relative to its install directory.
#### Returns

* string

  The fully-qualified URL to the resource.
### openOptionsPage()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Open your Extension's options page, if possible.

The precise behavior may depend on your manifest's [`options_ui`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#embedded_options) or [`options_page`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#full_page) key, or what Chrome happens to support at the time. For example, the page may be opened in a new tab, within chrome://extensions, within an App, or it may just focus an open options page. It will never cause the caller page to reload.

If your Extension does not declare an options page, or Chrome failed to create one for some other reason, the callback will set [`lastError`](#property-lastError).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### reload()

```
chrome.runtime.reload()
```

Reloads the app or extension. This method is not supported in kiosk mode. For kiosk mode, use chrome.runtime.restart() method.

### requestUpdateCheck()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.requestUpdateCheck(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Requests an immediate update check be done for this app/extension.

**Important**: Most extensions/apps should **not** use this method, since Chrome already does automatic checks every few hours, and you can listen for the [`runtime.onUpdateAvailable`](#event-onUpdateAvailable) event without needing to call requestUpdateCheck.

This method is only appropriate to call in very limited circumstances, such as if your extension talks to a backend service, and the backend service has determined that the client extension version is very far out of date and you'd like to prompt a user to update. Most other uses of requestUpdateCheck, such as calling it unconditionally based on a repeating timer, probably only serve to waste client, network, and server resources.

Note: When called with a callback, instead of returning an object this function will return the two properties as separate arguments passed to the callback.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: object) => void
  ```

  + result

    object

    Chrome 109+

    RequestUpdateCheckResult object that holds the status of the update check and any details of the result if there is an update available

    - status

      [RequestUpdateCheckStatus](#type-RequestUpdateCheckStatus)

      Result of the update check.
    - version

      string optional

      If an update is available, this contains the version of the available update.
#### Returns

* Promise<object>

  Chrome 109+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### restart()

```
chrome.runtime.restart()
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode. Otherwise, it's no-op.

### restartAfterDelay()

Promise
Chrome 53+

```
chrome.runtime.restartAfterDelay(  
  seconds: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode after the given seconds. If called again before the time ends, the reboot will be delayed. If called with a value of -1, the reboot will be cancelled. It's a no-op in non-kiosk mode. It's only allowed to be called repeatedly by the first extension to invoke this API.

#### Parameters

* seconds

  number

  Time to wait in seconds before rebooting the device, or -1 to cancel a scheduled reboot.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### sendMessage()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(  
  extensionId?: string,  
  message: any,  
  options?: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Sends a single message to event listeners within your extension or a different extension/app. Similar to [`runtime.connect`](#method-connect) but only sends a single message, with an optional response. If sending to your extension, the [`runtime.onMessage`](#event-onMessage) event will be fired in every frame of your extension (except for the sender's frame), or [`runtime.onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal), if a different extension. Note that extensions cannot send messages to content scripts using this method. To send messages to content scripts, use [`tabs.sendMessage`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-sendMessage).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to send the message to. If omitted, the message will be sent to your own extension/app. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable).
* message

  any

  The message to send. This message should be a JSON-ifiable object.
* options

  object optional

  + includeTlsChannelId

    boolean optional

    Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onMessageExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.
* callback

  function optional

  Chrome 99+

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (response: any) => void
  ```

  + response

    any

    The JSON response object sent by the handler of the message. If an error occurs while connecting to the extension, the callback will be called with no arguments and [`runtime.lastError`](#property-lastError) will be set to the error message.
#### Returns

* Promise<any>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

Fired when a profile that has this extension installed first starts up. This event is not fired when an incognito profile is started, even if this extension is operating in 'split' incognito mode.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSuspend

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspend.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Sent to the event page just before it is unloaded. This gives the extension opportunity to do some clean up. Note that since the page is unloading, any asynchronous operations started while handling this event are not guaranteed to complete. If more activity for the event page occurs before it gets unloaded the onSuspendCanceled event will be sent and the page won't be unloaded.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSuspendCanceled

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspendCanceled.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Sent after onSuspend to indicate that the app won't be unloaded after all.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onUpdateAvailable

```
chrome.runtime.onUpdateAvailable.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when an update is available, but isn't installed immediately because the app is currently running. If you do nothing, the update will be installed the next time the background page gets unloaded, if you want it to be installed sooner you can explicitly call chrome.runtime.reload(). If your extension is using a persistent background page, the background page of course never gets unloaded, so unless you call chrome.runtime.reload() manually in response to this event the update will not get installed until the next time Chrome itself restarts. If no handlers are listening for this event, and your extension has a persistent background page, it behaves as if chrome.runtime.reload() is called in response to this event.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (details: object) => void
  ```

  + details

    object

    - version

      string

      The version number of the available update.

# chrome.runtime  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime/

# chrome.runtime

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.runtime` API to retrieve the service worker, return details about the manifest, and listen for and respond to events in the extension lifecycle. You can also use this API to convert the relative path of URLs to fully-qualified URLs.

Most members of this API do **not** require any permissions. This permission is needed for [`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative), [`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage) and [`onNativeConnect`](#event-onConnectNative).

The following example shows how to declare the `"nativeMessaging"` permission in the manifest:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "nativeMessaging"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

The Runtime API provides methods to support a number of areas that your extensions
can use:

Message passing
Your extension can communicate with different contexts within your extension and also with other extensions using these methods and events:
[`connect()`](#method-connect),
[`onConnect`](#event-onConnect),
[`onConnectExternal`](#event-onConnectExternal),
[`sendMessage()`](#method-sendMessage),
[`onMessage`](#event-onMessage) and
[`onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal).
In addition, your extension can pass messages to native applications on the user's device using
[`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative) and
[`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage).

Accessing extension and platform metadata
These methods let you retrieve several specific pieces of metadata about the extension and the
platform. Methods in this category include
[`getManifest()`](#method-getManifest), and
[`getPlatformInfo()`](#method-getPlatformInfo).
Managing extension lifecycle and options
These properties let you perform some meta-operations on the extension, and display the options page.
Methods and events in this category include
[`onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled),
[`onStartup`](#event-onStartup),
[`openOptionsPage()`](#method-openOptionsPage),
[`reload()`](#method-reload),
[`requestUpdateCheck()`](#method-requestUpdateCheck), and
[`setUninstallURL()`](#method-setUninstallURL).
Helper utilities
These methods provide utility such as the conversion of internal resource representations to
external formats. Methods in this category include
[`getURL()`](#method-getURL).
Kiosk mode utilities
These methods are available only on ChromeOS, and exist mainly to support kiosk implementations.
Methods in this category include
[`restart()`](#method-restart) and
[`restartAfterDelay()``](#method-restartAfterDelay).
### Unpacked extension behavior

When an [unpacked](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) extension is [reloaded](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#reload), this is treated as an update. This means that the
[`chrome.runtime.onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled) event will fire with the `"update"` reason. This
includes when the extension is reloaded with [`chrome.runtime.reload()`](#method-reload).

## Use cases

### Add an image to a web page

For a web page to access an asset hosted on another domain, it must specify the resource's full URL
(e.g. `<img src="https://example.com/logo.png">`). The same is true to include an extension asset on
a web page. The two differences are that the extension's assets must be exposed as [web
accessible resources](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) and that typically content scripts are responsible for injecting
extension assets.

In this example, the extension will add `logo.png` to the page that the [content
script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts) is being [injected](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality) into by using `runtime.getURL()` to create a
fully-qualified URL. But first, the asset must be declared as a web accessible resource in the manifest.

manifest.json:

```
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [ "logo.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://*/*" ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

content.js:

```
{ // Block used to avoid setting global variables
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = chrome.runtime.getURL('logo.png');
  document.body.append(img);
}

```
### Send data from a content script to the service worker

Its common for an extension's content scripts to need data managed by another part of the extension,
like the service worker. Much like two browser windows opened to the same web page, these
two contexts cannot directly access each other's values. Instead, the extension can use [message
passing](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging) to coordinate across these different contexts.

In this example, the content script needs some data from the extension's service worker to
initialize its UI. To get this data, it passes the developer-defined `get-user-data` message
to the service worker, and it responds with a copy of the user's information.

content.js:

```
// 1. Send a message to the service worker requesting the user's data
chrome.runtime.sendMessage('get-user-data', (response) => {
  // 3. Got an asynchronous response with the data from the service worker
  console.log('received user data', response);
  initializeUI(response);
});

```

service-worker.js:

```
// Example of a simple user data object
const user = {
  username: 'demo-user'
};

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  // 2. A page requested user data, respond with a copy of `user`
  if (message === 'get-user-data') {
    sendResponse(user);
  }
});

```
### Gather feedback on uninstall

Many extensions use post-uninstall surveys to understand how the extension could better serve its
users and improve retention. The following example shows how to add this functionality.

background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(details => {
  if (details.reason === chrome.runtime.OnInstalledReason.INSTALL) {
    chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL('https://example.com/extension-survey');
  }
});

```
## Examples

See the [Manifest V3 - Web Accessible Resources demo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/web-accessible-resources) for more Runtime API examples.

  Event<functionvoidvoid>

  Fired when the port is disconnected from the other end(s). [`runtime.lastError`](#property-lastError) may be set if the port was disconnected by an error. If the port is closed via [disconnect](#method-Port-disconnect), then this event is *only* fired on the other end. This event is fired at most once (see also [Port lifetime](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/messaging#port-lifetime)).

  The `onDisconnect.addListener` function looks like:
  ```
  (callback: function) => {...}
  ```

  + callback

    function

    The `callback` parameter looks like:
    ```
    (port: [Port](#type-Port)) => void
    ```

    - port

      [Port](#type-Port)
* onMessage

  Event<functionvoidvoid>

  This event is fired when [postMessage](#method-Port-postMessage) is called by the other end of the port.

  The `onMessage.addListener` function looks like:
  ```
  (callback: function) => {...}
  ```

  + callback

    function

    The `callback` parameter looks like:
    ```
    (message: any, port: [Port](#type-Port)) => void
    ```

    - message

      any
    - port

      [Port](#type-Port)
* sender

  [MessageSender](#type-MessageSender) optional

  This property will **only** be present on ports passed to [onConnect](#event-onConnect) / [onConnectExternal](#event-onConnectExternal) / [onConnectNative](#event-onConnectExternal) listeners.
* disconnect

  void

  Immediately disconnect the port. Calling `disconnect()` on an already-disconnected port has no effect. When a port is disconnected, no new events will be dispatched to this port.

  The `disconnect` function looks like:
  ```
  () => {...}
  ```
* postMessage

  void

  Send a message to the other end of the port. If the port is disconnected, an error is thrown.

  The `postMessage` function looks like:
  ```
  (message: any) => {...}
  ```

  + message

    any

    Chrome 52+

    The message to send. This object should be JSON-ifiable.
### RequestUpdateCheckStatus

Chrome 44+

Result of the update check.

#### Enum

"throttled"   
 Specifies that the status check has been throttled. This can occur after repeated checks within a short amount of time.

"no\_update"   
 Specifies that there are no available updates to install.

"update\_available"   
 Specifies that there is an available update to install.

## Properties

### id

The ID of the extension/app.

#### Type

string

### lastError

Populated with an error message if calling an API function fails; otherwise undefined. This is only defined within the scope of that function's callback. If an error is produced, but `runtime.lastError` is not accessed within the callback, a message is logged to the console listing the API function that produced the error. API functions that return promises do not set this property.

#### Type

object

#### Properties

* message

  string optional

  Details about the error which occurred.
## Methods

### connect()

```
chrome.runtime.connect(  
  extensionId?: string,  
  connectInfo?: object,  
)
```

Attempts to connect listeners within an extension (such as the background page), or other extensions/apps. This is useful for content scripts connecting to their extension processes, inter-app/extension communication, and [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable). Note that this does not connect to any listeners in a content script. Extensions may connect to content scripts embedded in tabs via [`tabs.connect`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-connect).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to connect to. If omitted, a connection will be attempted with your own extension. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/externally-connectable).
* connectInfo

  object optional

  + includeTlsChannelId

    boolean optional

    Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onConnectExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.
  + name

    string optional

    Will be passed into onConnect for processes that are listening for the connection event.
#### Returns

* [Port](#type-Port)

  Port through which messages can be sent and received. The port's [onDisconnect](#type-Port) event is fired if the extension does not exist.
### connectNative()

```
chrome.runtime.connectNative(  
  application: string,  
)
```

Connects to a native application in the host machine. This method requires the `"nativeMessaging"` permission. See [Native Messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) for more information.

#### Parameters

* application

  string

  The name of the registered application to connect to.
#### Returns

* [Port](#type-Port)

  Port through which messages can be sent and received with the application
### getBackgroundPage()

Promise
Foreground only
Deprecated
```
chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Background pages do not exist in MV3 extensions.

Retrieves the JavaScript 'window' object for the background page running inside the current extension/app. If the background page is an event page, the system will ensure it is loaded before calling the callback. If there is no background page, an error is set.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (backgroundPage?: Window) => void
  ```

  + backgroundPage

    Window optional

    The JavaScript 'window' object for the background page.
#### Returns

* Promise<Window | undefined>

  ```

  + platformInfo

    [PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)
#### Returns

* Promise<[PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getURL()

```
chrome.runtime.getURL(  
  path: string,  
)
```

Converts a relative path within an app/extension install directory to a fully-qualified URL.

#### Parameters

* path

  string

  A path to a resource within an app/extension expressed relative to its install directory.
#### Returns

* string

  The fully-qualified URL to the resource.
### openOptionsPage()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Open your Extension's options page, if possible.

The precise behavior may depend on your manifest's [`options_ui`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#embedded_options) or [`options_page`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#full_page) key, or what Chrome happens to support at the time. For example, the page may be opened in a new tab, within chrome://extensions, within an App, or it may just focus an open options page. It will never cause the caller page to reload.

If your Extension does not declare an options page, or Chrome failed to create one for some other reason, the callback will set [`lastError`](#property-lastError).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### reload()

```
chrome.runtime.reload()
```

Reloads the app or extension. This method is not supported in kiosk mode. For kiosk mode, use chrome.runtime.restart() method.

### requestUpdateCheck()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.requestUpdateCheck(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Requests an immediate update check be done for this app/extension.

**Important**: Most extensions/apps should **not** use this method, since Chrome already does automatic checks every few hours, and you can listen for the [`runtime.onUpdateAvailable`](#event-onUpdateAvailable) event without needing to call requestUpdateCheck.

This method is only appropriate to call in very limited circumstances, such as if your extension talks to a backend service, and the backend service has determined that the client extension version is very far out of date and you'd like to prompt a user to update. Most other uses of requestUpdateCheck, such as calling it unconditionally based on a repeating timer, probably only serve to waste client, network, and server resources.

Note: When called with a callback, instead of returning an object this function will return the two properties as separate arguments passed to the callback.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: object) => void
  ```

  + result

    object

    Chrome 109+

    RequestUpdateCheckResult object that holds the status of the update check and any details of the result if there is an update available

    - status

      [RequestUpdateCheckStatus](#type-RequestUpdateCheckStatus)

      Result of the update check.
    - version

      string optional

      If an update is available, this contains the version of the available update.
#### Returns

* Promise<object>

  Chrome 109+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### restart()

```
chrome.runtime.restart()
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode. Otherwise, it's no-op.

### restartAfterDelay()

Promise
Chrome 53+

```
chrome.runtime.restartAfterDelay(  
  seconds: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode after the given seconds. If called again before the time ends, the reboot will be delayed. If called with a value of -1, the reboot will be cancelled. It's a no-op in non-kiosk mode. It's only allowed to be called repeatedly by the first extension to invoke this API.

#### Parameters

* seconds

  number

  Time to wait in seconds before rebooting the device, or -1 to cancel a scheduled reboot.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 99+

### sendMessage()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(  
  extensionId?: string,  
  message: any,  
  options?: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Sends a single message to event listeners within your extension or a different extension/app. Similar to [`runtime.connect`](#method-connect) but only sends a single message, with an optional response. If sending to your extension, the [`runtime.onMessage`](#event-onMessage) event will be fired in every frame of your extension (except for the sender's frame), or [`runtime.onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal), if a different extension. Note that extensions cannot send messages to content scripts using this method. To send messages to content scripts, use [`tabs.sendMessage`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-sendMessage).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to send the message to. If omitted, the message will be sent to your own extension/app. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSuspend

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspend.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Sent to the event page just before it is unloaded. This gives the extension opportunity to do some clean up. Note that since the page is unloading, any asynchronous operations started while handling this event are not guaranteed to complete. If more activity for the event page occurs before it gets unloaded the onSuspendCanceled event will be sent and the page won't be unloaded.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSuspendCanceled

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspendCanceled.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Sent after onSuspend to indicate that the app won't be unloaded after all.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onUpdateAvailable

```
chrome.runtime.onUpdateAvailable.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when an update is available, but isn't installed immediately because the app is currently running. If you do nothing, the update will be installed the next time the background page gets unloaded, if you want it to be installed sooner you can explicitly call chrome.runtime.reload(). If your extension is using a persistent background page, the background page of course never gets unloaded, so unless you call chrome.runtime.reload() manually in response to this event the update will not get installed until the next time Chrome itself restarts. If no handlers are listening for this event, and your extension has a persistent background page, it behaves as if chrome.runtime.reload() is called in response to this event.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (details: object) => void
  ```

  + details

    object

    - version

      string

      The version number of the available update.

# chrome.scripting  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting

# chrome.scripting

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.scripting` API to execute script in different contexts.

## Permissions

`scripting`  
## Availability

Chrome 88+
MV3+

## Manifest

To use the `chrome.scripting` API, declare the `"scripting"` permission in the [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) plus the host permissions for the pages to inject scripts into. Use the [`"host_permissions"`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) key or the [`"activeTab"`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, which grants temporary host permissions. The following example uses the activeTab permission.

```
{
  "name": "Scripting Extension",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab"],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

You can use the `chrome.scripting` API to inject JavaScript and CSS into
websites. This is similar to what you can do with [content
scripts](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts). But by using the [`chrome.scripting`](/docs/extensions/reference/scripting) namespace, extensions
can make decisions at runtime.

### Injection targets

You can use the `target` parameter to specify a target to inject JavaScript or
CSS into.

The only required field is `tabId`. By default, an injection will run in the
main frame of the specified tab.

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("script injected"));

```

To run in all frames of the specified tab, you can set the `allFrames` boolean
to `true`.

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("script injected in all frames"));

```

You can also inject into specific frames of a tab by specifying individual frame
IDs. For more information on frame IDs, see the [`chrome.webNavigation`
API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webNavigation).

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), frameIds : [ frameId1, frameId2 ]},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("script injected on target frames"));

```
### Injected code

Extensions can specify the code to be injected either via an external file or a
runtime variable.

#### Files

Files are specified as strings that are paths relative to the extension's root
directory. The following code will inject the file `script.js` into the main
frame of the tab.

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected script file"));

```
#### Runtime functions

When injecting JavaScript with `scripting.executeScript()`, you can specify a
function to be executed instead of a file. This function should be a function
variable available to the current extension context.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getTitle() { return document.title; }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : getTitle,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```
```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getUserColor() { ... }

function changeBackgroundColor() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = getUserColor();
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : changeBackgroundColor,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```

You can work around this by using the `args` property:

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getUserColor() { ... }
function changeBackgroundColor(backgroundColor) {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = backgroundColor;
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : changeBackgroundColor,
      args : [ getUserColor() ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```
#### Runtime strings

If injecting CSS within a page, you can also specify a string to be used in the
`css` property. This option is only available for `scripting.insertCSS()`; you
can't execute a string using `scripting.executeScript()`.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
const css = "body { background-color: red; }";

chrome.scripting
    .insertCSS({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      css : css,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("CSS injected"));

```
### Handle the results

The results of executing JavaScript are passed to the extension. A single result
is included per-frame. The main frame is guaranteed to be the first index in the
resulting array; all other frames are in a non-deterministic order.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getTitle() { return document.title; }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      func : getTitle,
    })
    .then(injectionResults => {
      for (const {frameId, result} of injectionResults) {
        console.log(`Frame ${frameId} result:`, result);
      }
    });

```

`scripting.insertCSS()` does not return any results.

#### Promises

If the resulting value of the script execution is a promise, Chrome will wait
for the promise to settle and return the resulting value.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
async function addIframe() {
  const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
  const loadComplete =
      new Promise(resolve => iframe.addEventListener("load", resolve));
  iframe.src = "https://example.com";
  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
  await loadComplete;
  return iframe.contentWindow.document.title;
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      func : addIframe,
    })
    .then(injectionResults => {
      for (const frameResult of injectionResults) {
        const {frameId, result} = frameResult;
        console.log(`Frame ${frameId} result:`, result);
      }
    });

```
## Examples

### Unregister all dynamic content scripts

The following snippet contains a function that unregisters all dynamic content
scripts the extension has previously registered.

```
async function unregisterAllDynamicContentScripts() {
  try {
    const scripts = await chrome.scripting.getRegisteredContentScripts();
    const scriptIds = scripts.map(script => script.id);
    return chrome.scripting.unregisterContentScripts(scriptIds);
  } catch (error) {
    const message = [
      "An unexpected error occurred while",
      "unregistering dynamic content scripts.",
    ].join(" ");
    throw new Error(message, {cause : error});
  }
}

```

  A JavaScript function to inject. This function will be serialized, and then deserialized for injection. This means that any bound parameters and execution context will be lost. Exactly one of `files` or `func` must be specified.

  The `func` function looks like:
  ```
  () => {...}
  ```
### StyleOrigin

The origin for a style change. See [style origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Style_origin) for more info.

# chrome.sidePanel  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel

# chrome.sidePanel

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.sidePanel` API to host content in the browser's side panel alongside the main content of a webpage.

## Permissions

`sidePanel`  

To use the Side Panel API, add the `"sidePanel"` permission in the extension [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) file:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My side panel extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "sidePanel"
  ]
}

```
## Availability

Chrome 114+
MV3+

## Concepts and usage

The Side Panel API allows extensions to display their own UI in the side panel, enabling persistent experiences that complement the user's browsing journey.

Some features include:

* The side panel remains open when navigating between tabs (if set to do so).
* It can be available only on specific websites.
* As an extension page, side panels have access to all Chrome APIs.
* Within Chrome's settings, users can specify which side the panel should be displayed on.

### Use cases

The following sections demonstrate some common use cases for the Side Panel API. See [Extension samples](#examples) for complete extension examples.

#### Display the same side panel on every site

The side panel can be set initially from the `"default_path"` property in the `"side_panel"` key of the manifest to display the same side panel on every site. This should point to a relative path within the extension directory.

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My side panel extension",
  ...
  "side_panel": {
    "default_path": "sidepanel.html"
  }
  ...
}

```

sidepanel.html:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Sidepanel</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>All sites sidepanel extension</h1>
    <p>This side panel is enabled on all sites</p>
  </body>
</html>

```
#### Enable a side panel on a specific site

An extension can use [`sidepanel.setOptions()`](#method-setOptions) to enable a side panel on a specific tab. This example uses [`chrome.tabs.onUpdated()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#event-onUpdated) to listen for any updates made to the tab. It checks if the URL is [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) and enables the side panel. Otherwise, it disables it.

service-worker.js:

```
const GOOGLE_ORIGIN = 'https://www.google.com';

chrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener(async (tabId, info, tab) => {
  if (!tab.url) return;
  const url = new URL(tab.url);
  // Enables the side panel on google.com
  if (url.origin === GOOGLE_ORIGIN) {
    await chrome.sidePanel.setOptions({
      tabId,
      path: 'sidepanel.html',
      enabled: true
    });
  } else {
    // Disables the side panel on all other sites
    await chrome.sidePanel.setOptions({
      tabId,
      enabled: false
    });
  }
});

```

When a user temporarily switches to a tab where the side panel is not enabled, the side panel will be hidden. It will automatically show again when the user switches to a tab where it was previously open.

When the user navigates to a site where the side panel is not enabled, the side panel will close, and the extension won't show in the side panel drop-down menu.

For a complete example, see the [Tab-specific side panel](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.sidepanel-site-specific) sample.

#### Open the side panel by clicking the toolbar icon

Developers can allow users to open the side panel when they click the action toolbar icon with [`sidePanel.setPanelBehavior()`](#method-setPanelBehavior). First, declare the `"action"` key in the manifest:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My side panel extension",
  ...
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Click to open panel"
  },
  ...
}

```

Now, add this code to the previous example:

service-worker.js:

```
const GOOGLE_ORIGIN = 'https://www.google.com';

// Allows users to open the side panel by clicking on the action toolbar icon
chrome.sidePanel
  .setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true })
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
...

```
#### Programmatically open the side panel on user interaction

Chrome 116 introduces [`sidePanel.open()`](#method-open). It allows extensions to open the side panel through an extension user gesture, such as [clicking on the action icon](/docs/extensions/reference/api/action). Or a user interaction on an extension page or [content script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts), such as clicking a button. For a complete demo, see the [Open Side Panel](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.sidepanel-open) sample extension.

The following code shows how to open a global side panel on the current window when the user clicks on a context menu. When using [`sidePanel.open()`](#method-open), you must choose the context in which it should open. Use [`windowId`](#property-OpenOptions-windowId) to open a global side panel. Alternatively, set the [`tabId`](#property-OpenOptions-tabId) to open the side panel only on a specific tab.

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  chrome.contextMenus.create({
    id: 'openSidePanel',
    title: 'Open side panel',
    contexts: ['all']
  });
});

chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((info, tab) => {
  if (info.menuItemId === 'openSidePanel') {
    // This will open the panel in all the pages on the current window.
    chrome.sidePanel.open({ windowId: tab.windowId });
  }
});

```
#### Switch to a different panel

Extensions can use [`sidepanel.getOptions()`](#method-getOptions) to retrieve the current side panel. The following example sets a welcome side panel on [`runtime.onInstalled()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#event-onInstalled). Then when the user navigates to a different tab, it replaces it with the main side panel.

service-worker.js:

```
const welcomePage = 'sidepanels/welcome-sp.html';
const mainPage = 'sidepanels/main-sp.html';

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  chrome.sidePanel.setOptions({ path: welcomePage });
  chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true });
});

chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(async ({ tabId }) => {
  const { path } = await chrome.sidePanel.getOptions({ tabId });
  if (path === welcomePage) {
    chrome.sidePanel.setOptions({ path: mainPage });
  }
});

```

See the [Multiple side panels](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.sidepanel-multiple) sample for the full code.

### Side panel user experience

Users will see Chrome's built-in side panels first. Each side panel displays the extension's icon in the side panel menu. If no icons are included, it will show a placeholder icon with the first letter of the extension's name.

#### Open the side panel

To allow users to open the side panel, use an action icon in combination
with [`sidePanel.setPanelBehavior()`](#open-action-icon). Alternatively, make a call to [`sidePanel.open()`](#user-interaction) following a user interaction, such as:

* An [action click](/docs/extensions/reference/api/action)
* A [keyboard shortcut](/docs/extensions/reference/api/commands)
* A [context menu](/docs/extensions/reference/api/contextMenus)
* A [user gesture](#user-interaction) on an extension page or content script.

#### Pin the side panel

The side panel toolbar displays a pin icon when your side panel is open.
Clicking the icon pins your extension's action icon. Clicking the action icon
once pinned will perform the default action for your action icon and will only
open the side panel if this has been explicitly configured.

## Examples

For more Side Panel API extensions demos, explore any of the following extensions:

* [Dictionary side panel](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/sample.sidepanel-dictionary).
* [Global side panel](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.sidepanel-global).
* [Multiple side panels](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.sidepanel-multiple).
* [Open Side panel](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.sidepanel-open).
* [Site-specific side panel](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/cookbook.sidepanel-site-specific).

## Types

### GetPanelOptions

#### Properties

* tabId

  number optional

  If specified, the side panel options for the given tab will be returned. Otherwise, returns the default side panel options (used for any tab that doesn't have specific settings).
### OpenOptions

Chrome 116+

#### Properties

* tabId

  number optional

  The tab in which to open the side panel. If the corresponding tab has a tab-specific side panel, the panel will only be open for that tab. If there is not a tab-specific panel, the global panel will be open in the specified tab and any other tabs without a currently-open tab- specific panel. This will override any currently-active side panel (global or tab-specific) in the corresponding tab. At least one of this or `windowId` must be provided.
* windowId

  number optional

  The window in which to open the side panel. This is only applicable if the extension has a global (non-tab-specific) side panel or `tabId` is also specified. This will override any currently-active global side panel the user has open in the given window. At least one of this or `tabId` must be provided.
### PanelBehavior

#### Properties

* openPanelOnActionClick

  boolean optional

  Whether clicking the extension's icon will toggle showing the extension's entry in the side panel. Defaults to false.
### PanelOptions

#### Properties

* enabled

  boolean optional

  Whether the side panel should be enabled. This is optional. The default value is true.
* path

  string optional

  The path to the side panel HTML file to use. This must be a local resource within the extension package.
* tabId

  number optional

  If specified, the side panel options will only apply to the tab with this id. If omitted, these options set the default behavior (used for any tab that doesn't have specific settings). Note: if the same path is set for this tabId and the default tabId, then the panel for this tabId will be a different instance than the panel for the default tabId.
### SidePanel

#### Properties

* default\_path

  string

  Developer specified path for side panel display.

# chrome.storage  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage

# chrome.storage

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.storage` API to store, retrieve, and track changes to user data.

## Permissions

`storage`  

To use the storage API, declare the `"storage"` permission in the extension
[manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "storage"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

The Storage API provides an extension-specific way to persist user data and state. It's similar to the web platform's storage APIs ([IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/indexeddb), and [Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage)), but was designed to meet the storage needs of extensions. The following are a few key features:

* All extension contexts, including the extension service worker and content scripts have access to the Storage API.
* The JSON serializable values are stored as object properties.
* The Storage API is asynchronous with bulk read and write operations.
* Even if the user clears the cache and browsing history, the data persists.
* Stored settings persist even when using [split incognito](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/incognito).
* Includes an exclusive read-only [managed storage area](#property-managed) for enterprise policies.

### Can extensions use web storage APIs?

While extensions can use the [`Storage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage) interface (accessible from `window.localStorage`) in some contexts (popup and other HTML pages), we don't recommend it for the following reasons:

* Extension service workers can't use the Web Storage API.
* Content scripts share storage with the host page.
* Data saved using the Web Storage API is lost when the user clears their browsing history.

To move data from web storage APIs to extension storage APIs from a service worker:

1. Prepare an offscreen document html page and script file. The script file should contain a conversion routine and an [`onMessage`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#event-onMessage) handler.
2. In the extension service worker, check `chrome.storage` for your data.
3. If your data isn't found, call [`createDocument()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/offscreen#method-createDocument).
4. After the returned Promise resolves, call [`sendMessage()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#method-sendMessage) to start the conversion routine.
5. Inside the offscreen document's `onMessage` handler, call the conversion routine.

There are also some nuances to how web storage APIs work in extensions. Learn more in the
[Storage and Cookies](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/storage-and-cookies) article.

### Storage areas

The Storage API is divided into the following storage areas:

[`storage.local`](#property-local)
Data is stored locally and cleared when the extension is removed. The storage limit is 10 MB (5 MB in Chrome 113 and earlier), but can be increased by requesting the `"unlimitedStorage"` permission. We recommend using `storage.local` to store larger amounts of data.
[`storage.managed`](#property-managed)
Managed storage is read-only storage for policy installed extensions and managed by system administrators using a developer-defined schema and enterprise policies. Policies are analogous to options but are configured by a system administrator instead of the user, allowing the extension to be preconfigured for all users of an organization. For information on policies, see [Documentation for Administrators](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/). To learn more about the `managed` storage area, see [Manifest for storage areas](/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage).
[`storage.session`](#property-session)
Holds data in memory for the duration of a browser session. By default, it's not exposed to content scripts, but this behavior can be changed by setting [`chrome.storage.session.setAccessLevel()`](#method-StorageArea-setAccessLevel). The storage limit is 10 MB (1 MB in Chrome 111 and earlier). The`storage.session` interface is one of several [we recommend for service workers](/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers/service-worker-lifecycle#persist-data).
[`storage.sync`](#property-sync)
If syncing is enabled, the data is synced to any Chrome browser that the user is logged into. If disabled, it behaves like `storage.local`. Chrome stores the data locally when the browser is offline and resumes syncing when it's back online. The quota limitation is approximately 100 KB, 8 KB per item. We recommend using `storage.sync` to preserve user settings across synced browsers. If you're working with sensitive user data, instead use `storage.session`.
### Storage and throttling limits

The Storage API has the following usage limitations:

* Storing data often comes with performance costs, and the API includes storage quotas. We recommend being careful about what data you store so that you don't lose the ability to store data.
* Storage can take time to complete. Make sure to structure your code to account for that time.

For details on storage area limitations and what happens when they're exceeded, see the quota information for [`sync`](#property-sync), [`local`](#property-local), and [`session`](#property-session).

## Use cases

The following sections demonstrate common use cases for the Storage API.

### Synchronous response to storage updates

To track changes made to storage, add a listener to its `onChanged` event. When anything changes in storage, that event fires. The sample code listens for these changes:

background.js:

```
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, namespace) => {
  for (let [key, { oldValue, newValue }] of Object.entries(changes)) {
    console.log(
      `Storage key "${key}" in namespace "${namespace}" changed.`,
      `Old value was "${oldValue}", new value is "${newValue}".`
    );
  }
});

```

We can take this idea even further. In this example, we have an [options page](/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page) that
allows the user to toggle a "debug mode" (implementation not shown here). The options page immediately saves the new settings to `storage.sync`, and the service worker uses `storage.onChanged` to apply the setting as soon as possible.

options.html:

```
<!-- type="module" allows you to use top level await -->
<script defer src="options.js" type="module"></script>
<form id="optionsForm">
  <label for="debug">
    <input type="checkbox" name="debug" id="debug">
    Enable debug mode
  </label>
</form>

```

options.js:

```
// In-page cache of the user's options
const options = {};
const optionsForm = document.getElementById("optionsForm");

// Immediately persist options changes
optionsForm.debug.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  options.debug = event.target.checked;
  chrome.storage.sync.set({ options });
});

// Initialize the form with the user's option settings
const data = await chrome.storage.sync.get("options");
Object.assign(options, data.options);
optionsForm.debug.checked = Boolean(options.debug);

```

background.js:

```
function setDebugMode() { /* ... */ }

// Watch for changes to the user's options & apply them
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, area) => {
  if (area === 'sync' && changes.options?.newValue) {
    const debugMode = Boolean(changes.options.newValue.debug);
    console.log('enable debug mode?', debugMode);
    setDebugMode(debugMode);
  }
});

```
### Asynchronous preload from storage

Because service workers don't run all the time, Manifest V3 extensions sometimes need to
asynchronously load data from storage before they execute their event handlers. To do this, the
following snippet uses an async `action.onClicked` event handler that waits for the `storageCache`
global to be populated before executing its logic.

background.js:

```
// Where we will expose all the data we retrieve from storage.sync.
const storageCache = { count: 0 };
// Asynchronously retrieve data from storage.sync, then cache it.
const initStorageCache = chrome.storage.sync.get().then((items) => {
  // Copy the data retrieved from storage into storageCache.
  Object.assign(storageCache, items);
});

chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async (tab) => {
  try {
    await initStorageCache;
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error that occurred during storage initialization.
  }

  // Normal action handler logic.
  storageCache.count++;
  storageCache.lastTabId = tab.id;
  chrome.storage.sync.set(storageCache);
});

```
## Examples

The following samples demonstrate the `local`, `sync`, and
`session` storage areas:

### Local

```
chrome.storage.local.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
  console.log("Value is set");
});

chrome.storage.local.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
  console.log("Value is " + result.key);
});

```

### Sync

```
chrome.storage.sync.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
  console.log("Value is set");
});

chrome.storage.sync.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
  console.log("Value is " + result.key);
});

```

### Session

```
chrome.storage.session.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
  console.log("Value was set");
});

chrome.storage.session.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
  console.log("Value is " + result.key);
});

```

  any optional

  The old value of the item, if there was an old value.
## Properties

### local

Items in the `local` storage area are local to each machine.

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea) & object

#### Properties

* QUOTA\_BYTES

  10485760   

  The maximum amount (in bytes) of data that can be stored in local storage, as measured by the JSON stringification of every value plus every key's length. This value will be ignored if the extension has the `unlimitedStorage` permission. Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or a rejected Promise if using async/await.
### managed

Items in the `managed` storage area are set by an enterprise policy configured by the domain administrator, and are read-only for the extension; trying to modify this namespace results in an error. For information on configuring a policy, see [Manifest for storage areas](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/storage).

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea)

### session

Chrome 102+
MV3+

Items in the `session` storage area are stored in-memory and will not be persisted to disk.

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea) & object

#### Properties

* QUOTA\_BYTES

  10485760   

  The maximum amount (in bytes) of data that can be stored in memory, as measured by estimating the dynamically allocated memory usage of every value and key. Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
### sync

Items in the `sync` storage area are synced using Chrome Sync.

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea) & object

Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded will fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
* MAX\_SUSTAINED\_WRITE\_OPERATIONS\_PER\_MINUTE

  1000000   

  Deprecated

  The storage.sync API no longer has a sustained write operation quota.
* MAX\_WRITE\_OPERATIONS\_PER\_HOUR

  1800   

  The maximum number of `set`, `remove`, or `clear` operations that can be performed each hour. This is 1 every 2 seconds, a lower ceiling than the short term higher writes-per-minute limit.

  Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
* MAX\_WRITE\_OPERATIONS\_PER\_MINUTE

  120   

  The maximum number of `set`, `remove`, or `clear` operations that can be performed each minute. This is 2 per second, providing higher throughput than writes-per-hour over a shorter period of time.

  Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
* QUOTA\_BYTES

  102400   

  The maximum total amount (in bytes) of data that can be stored in sync storage, as measured by the JSON stringification of every value plus every key's length.

# chrome.tabCapture  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabCapture

# chrome.tabCapture

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.tabCapture` API to interact with tab media streams.

## Permissions

`tabCapture`  
## Concepts and usage

The chrome.tabCapture API lets you access a [`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) containing video and
audio of the current tab. It can only be called after the user invokes an extension, such as by
clicking the extension's [action button](/docs/extensions/develop#actions). This is similar to the behavior of the
[`"activeTab"`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission.

### Preserve system audio

When a [`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) is obtained for a tab, audio in that tab will no longer be played
to the user. This is similar to the behavior of the [`getDisplayMedia()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia) function when
the [`suppressLocalAudioPlayback`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackSupportedConstraints/suppressLocalAudioPlayback) flag is set to true.

To continue playing audio to the user, use the following:

```
const output = new AudioContext();
const source = output.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
source.connect(output.destination);

```

This creates a new `AudioContext` and connects the audio of the tab's `MediaStream` to the default
destination.

### Stream IDs

Calling [`chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId()`](#method-getMediaStreamId) will return a stream ID. To later
access a [`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) from the ID, use the following:

```
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: "tab",
      chromeMediaSourceId: id,
    },
  },
  video: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: "tab",
      chromeMediaSourceId: id,
    },
  },
});

```
### Usage restrictions

After calling [`getMediaStreamId()`](#method-getMediaStreamId), there are restrictions on where the
returned stream ID can be used:

* If `consumerTabId` is specified, the ID can be used by a `getUserMedia()` call in any frame in the
  given tab which has the same security origin.
* When this is not specified, beginning in Chrome 116, the ID can be used in any frame with the
  same security origin in the same render process as the caller. This means that a stream ID obtained
  in a service worker can be used in an [offscreen document](/docs/extensions/reference/api/offscreen).

Prior to Chrome 116, when a `consumerTabId` was not specified, the stream ID was restricted to both
the security origin, render process and render frame of the caller.

### Learn more

To learn more about how to use the `chrome.tabCapture` API, see
[Audio recording and screen capture](/docs/extensions/how-to/web-platform/screen-capture). This demonstrates how to use
`tabCapture` and related APIs to solve a number of common use cases.

## Types

### CaptureInfo

#### Properties

* fullscreen

  boolean

  Whether an element in the tab being captured is in fullscreen mode.
* status

  [TabCaptureState](#type-TabCaptureState)

  The new capture status of the tab.
* tabId

  number

  The id of the tab whose status changed.
### CaptureOptions

#### Properties

* audio

  boolean optional
* audioConstraints

  [MediaStreamConstraint](#type-MediaStreamConstraint) optional
* video

  boolean optional
* videoConstraints

  [MediaStreamConstraint](#type-MediaStreamConstraint) optional
### GetMediaStreamOptions

Chrome 71+

#### Properties

* consumerTabId

  number optional

  Optional tab id of the tab which will later invoke `getUserMedia()` to consume the stream. If not specified then the resulting stream can be used only by the calling extension. The stream can only be used by frames in the given tab whose security origin matches the consumber tab's origin. The tab's origin must be a secure origin, e.g. HTTPS.
* targetTabId

  number optional

  Optional tab id of the tab which will be captured. If not specified then the current active tab will be selected. Only tabs for which the extension has been granted the `activeTab` permission can be used as the target tab.
### MediaStreamConstraint

#### Properties

* mandatory

  object
* optional

  object optional
### TabCaptureState

#### Enum

"pending"   

"active"   

"stopped"   

"error"   

## Methods

### capture()

Foreground only

```
chrome.tabCapture.capture(  
  options: [CaptureOptions](#type-CaptureOptions),  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Captures the visible area of the currently active tab. Capture can only be started on the currently active tab after the extension has been *invoked*, similar to the way that [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/activeTab#invoking-activeTab) works. Capture is maintained across page navigations within the tab, and stops when the tab is closed, or the media stream is closed by the extension.

#### Parameters

* options

  [CaptureOptions](#type-CaptureOptions)

  Configures the returned media stream.
* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (stream: LocalMediaStream) => void
  ```

  + stream

    LocalMediaStream
### getCapturedTabs()

Promise

```
chrome.tabCapture.getCapturedTabs(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Returns a list of tabs that have requested capture or are being captured, i.e. status != stopped and status != error. This allows extensions to inform the user that there is an existing tab capture that would prevent a new tab capture from succeeding (or to prevent redundant requests for the same tab).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: [CaptureInfo](#type-CaptureInfo)[]) => void
  ```

  + result

    [CaptureInfo](#type-CaptureInfo)[]
#### Returns

* Promise<[CaptureInfo](#type-CaptureInfo)[]>

  Chrome 116+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getMediaStreamId()

Promise
Chrome 71+

```
chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId(  
  options?: [GetMediaStreamOptions](#type-GetMediaStreamOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Creates a stream ID to capture the target tab. Similar to chrome.tabCapture.capture() method, but returns a media stream ID, instead of a media stream, to the consumer tab.

#### Parameters

* options

  [GetMediaStreamOptions](#type-GetMediaStreamOptions) optional
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (streamId: string) => void
  ```

  + streamId

    string
#### Returns

* Promise<string>

  Chrome 116+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onStatusChanged

```
chrome.tabCapture.onStatusChanged.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Event fired when the capture status of a tab changes. This allows extension authors to keep track of the capture status of tabs to keep UI elements like page actions in sync.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (info: [CaptureInfo](#type-CaptureInfo)) => void
  ```

  + info

    [CaptureInfo](#type-CaptureInfo)

# chrome.tabs  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs

# chrome.tabs

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.tabs` API to interact with the browser's tab system. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange tabs in the browser.

The Tabs API not only offers features for manipulating and managing tabs, but can also detect the
[language](#method-detectLanguage) of the tab, take a [screenshot](#method-captureVisibleTab), and
[communicate](#method-sendMessage) with a tab's content scripts.

## Permissions

Most features don't require any permissions to use. For example: [creating](#method-create) a new tab,
[reloading](#method-reload) a tab, [navigating](#method-update) to another URL, etc.

There are three permissions developers should be aware of when working with the Tabs API.

The "tabs" permission

This permission does not give access to the `chrome.tabs` namespace. Instead, it
grants an extension the ability to call [`tabs.query()`](#method-query) against four
sensitive properties on [`tabs.Tab`](#type-Tab) instances: `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and
`favIconUrl`.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "tabs"
  ],
  ...
}

```

Host permissions

[Host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) allow an extension to read and query a matching tab's four sensitive
`tabs.Tab` properties. They can also interact directly with the matching tabs using methods such
as [`tabs.captureVisibleTab()`](#method-captureVisibleTab),
[`tabs.executeScript()`](#method-executeScript), [`tabs.insertCSS()`](#method-insertCSS), and
[`tabs.removeCSS()`](#method-removeCSS).

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://*/*",
    "https://*/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```

The "activeTab" permission

[`activeTab`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) grants an extension temporary host permission for the current tab in
response to a user invocation. Unlike host permissions, `activeTab` does not trigger any warnings.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ],
  ...
}

```

## Use cases

The following sections demonstrate some common use cases.

### Open an extension page in a new tab

A common pattern for extensions is to open an onboarding page in a new tab when the extension is
installed. The following example shows how to do this.

background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(({reason}) => {
  if (reason === 'install') {
    chrome.tabs.create({
      url: "onboarding.html"
    });
  }
});

```
### Get the current tab

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can retrieve the active tab from the
currently-focused window (or most recently-focused window, if no Chrome windows are focused). This
can usually be thought of as the user's current tab.

```
  async function getCurrentTab() {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
    let [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions);
    return tab;
  }

```
```
  function getCurrentTab(callback) {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions, ([tab]) => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError)
      console.error(chrome.runtime.lastError);
      // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
      callback(tab);
    });
  }

```
### Mute the specified tab

This example shows how an extension can toggle the muted state for a given tab.

```
  async function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    const tab = await chrome.tabs.get(tabId);
    const muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
    await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, {muted});
    console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${muted ? "muted" : "unmuted"}`);
  }

```
```
  function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    chrome.tabs.get(tabId, async (tab) => {
      let muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
      await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, { muted });
      console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${ muted ? "muted" : "unmuted" }`);
    });
  }

```
### Move the current tab to the first position when clicked

This example shows how to move a tab while a drag may or may not be in progress. While this example
uses `chrome.tabs.move`, you can use the same waiting pattern for other calls that modify tabs while
a drag is in progress.

```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPosition);

  async function moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo) {
    try {
      await chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, {index: 0});
      console.log("Success.");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
        setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo), 50);
      } else {
        console.error(error);
      }
    }
  }

```
```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPositionMV2);

  function moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo) {
    chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, { index: 0 }, () => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        const error = chrome.runtime.lastError;
        if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
          setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo), 50);
        } else {
          console.error(error);
        }
      } else {
        console.log("Success.");
      }
    });
  }

```
### Pass a message to a selected tab's content script

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can communicate with content scripts in specific browser tabs using `tabs.sendMessage()`.

```
function sendMessageToActiveTab(message) {
  const [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true });
  const response = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, message);
  // TODO: Do something with the response.
}

```

  The width of the tab in pixels.
* windowId

  number

  The ID of the window that contains the tab.
### TabStatus

Chrome 44+

The tab's loading status.

"panel"   

"app"   

"devtools"   

### ZoomSettings

Defines how zoom changes in a tab are handled and at what scope.

#### Properties

* defaultZoomFactor

  number optional

  Chrome 43+

  Used to return the default zoom level for the current tab in calls to tabs.getZoomSettings.
* mode

  [ZoomSettingsMode](#type-ZoomSettingsMode) optional

  Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.
* scope

  [ZoomSettingsScope](#type-ZoomSettingsScope) optional

  Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.
### ZoomSettingsMode

Chrome 44+

Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.

#### Enum

"automatic"   
 Zoom changes are handled automatically by the browser.

"manual"   
 Overrides the automatic handling of zoom changes. The `onZoomChange` event will still be dispatched, and it is the extension's responsibility to listen for this event and manually scale the page. This mode does not support `per-origin` zooming, and thus ignores the `scope` zoom setting and assumes `per-tab`.

"disabled"   
 Disables all zooming in the tab. The tab reverts to the default zoom level, and all attempted zoom changes are ignored.

### ZoomSettingsScope

Chrome 44+

Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.

#### Enum

"per-origin"   
 Zoom changes persist in the zoomed page's origin, i.e., all other tabs navigated to that same origin are zoomed as well. Moreover, `per-origin` zoom changes are saved with the origin, meaning that when navigating to other pages in the same origin, they are all zoomed to the same zoom factor. The `per-origin` scope is only available in the `automatic` mode.

"per-tab"   
 Zoom changes only take effect in this tab, and zoom changes in other tabs do not affect the zooming of this tab. Also, `per-tab` zoom changes are reset on navigation; navigating a tab always loads pages with their `per-origin` zoom factors.

## Properties

### MAX\_CAPTURE\_VISIBLE\_TAB\_CALLS\_PER\_SECOND

Chrome 92+

The maximum number of times that [`captureVisibleTab`](#method-captureVisibleTab) can be called per second. [`captureVisibleTab`](#method-captureVisibleTab) is expensive and should not be called too often.

#### Value

2   

### TAB\_ID\_NONE

Chrome 46+

An ID that represents the absence of a browser tab.

#### Value

-1   

### TAB\_INDEX\_NONE

Chrome 123+

An index that represents the absence of a tab index in a tab\_strip.

#### Value

-1   

## Methods

### captureVisibleTab()

Promise

```
chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(  
  windowId?: number,  
  options?: [ImageDetails](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes/#type-ImageDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Captures the visible area of the currently active tab in the specified window. In order to call this method, the extension must have either the [<all\_urls>](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) permission or the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission. In addition to sites that extensions can normally access, this method allows extensions to capture sensitive sites that are otherwise restricted, including chrome:-scheme pages, other extensions' pages, and data: URLs. These sensitive sites can only be captured with the activeTab permission. File URLs may be captured only if the extension has been granted file access.

#### Parameters

* windowId

  number optional

  The target window. Defaults to the [current window](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/windows/#current-window).
* options

  [ImageDetails](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes/#type-ImageDetails) optional
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (dataUrl: string) => void
  ```

  + dataUrl

    string

    A data URL that encodes an image of the visible area of the captured tab. May be assigned to the 'src' property of an HTML `img` element for display.
#### Returns

* Promise<string>

  Chrome 88+

# chrome.tabs  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/

# chrome.tabs

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.tabs` API to interact with the browser's tab system. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange tabs in the browser.

The Tabs API not only offers features for manipulating and managing tabs, but can also detect the
[language](#method-detectLanguage) of the tab, take a [screenshot](#method-captureVisibleTab), and
[communicate](#method-sendMessage) with a tab's content scripts.

## Permissions

Most features don't require any permissions to use. For example: [creating](#method-create) a new tab,
[reloading](#method-reload) a tab, [navigating](#method-update) to another URL, etc.

There are three permissions developers should be aware of when working with the Tabs API.

The "tabs" permission

This permission does not give access to the `chrome.tabs` namespace. Instead, it
grants an extension the ability to call [`tabs.query()`](#method-query) against four
sensitive properties on [`tabs.Tab`](#type-Tab) instances: `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and
`favIconUrl`.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "tabs"
  ],
  ...
}

```

Host permissions

[Host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) allow an extension to read and query a matching tab's four sensitive
`tabs.Tab` properties. They can also interact directly with the matching tabs using methods such
as [`tabs.captureVisibleTab()`](#method-captureVisibleTab),
[`tabs.executeScript()`](#method-executeScript), [`tabs.insertCSS()`](#method-insertCSS), and
[`tabs.removeCSS()`](#method-removeCSS).

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://*/*",
    "https://*/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```

The "activeTab" permission

[`activeTab`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) grants an extension temporary host permission for the current tab in
response to a user invocation. Unlike host permissions, `activeTab` does not trigger any warnings.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ],
  ...
}

```

## Use cases

The following sections demonstrate some common use cases.

### Open an extension page in a new tab

A common pattern for extensions is to open an onboarding page in a new tab when the extension is
installed. The following example shows how to do this.

background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(({reason}) => {
  if (reason === 'install') {
    chrome.tabs.create({
      url: "onboarding.html"
    });
  }
});

```
### Get the current tab

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can retrieve the active tab from the
currently-focused window (or most recently-focused window, if no Chrome windows are focused). This
can usually be thought of as the user's current tab.

```
  async function getCurrentTab() {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
    let [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions);
    return tab;
  }

```
```
  function getCurrentTab(callback) {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions, ([tab]) => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError)
      console.error(chrome.runtime.lastError);
      // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
      callback(tab);
    });
  }

```
### Mute the specified tab

This example shows how an extension can toggle the muted state for a given tab.

```
  async function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    const tab = await chrome.tabs.get(tabId);
    const muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
    await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, {muted});
    console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${muted ? "muted" : "unmuted"}`);
  }

```
```
  function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    chrome.tabs.get(tabId, async (tab) => {
      let muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
      await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, { muted });
      console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${ muted ? "muted" : "unmuted" }`);
    });
  }

```
### Move the current tab to the first position when clicked

This example shows how to move a tab while a drag may or may not be in progress. While this example
uses `chrome.tabs.move`, you can use the same waiting pattern for other calls that modify tabs while
a drag is in progress.

```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPosition);

  async function moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo) {
    try {
      await chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, {index: 0});
      console.log("Success.");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
        setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo), 50);
      } else {
        console.error(error);
      }
    }
  }

```
```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPositionMV2);

  function moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo) {
    chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, { index: 0 }, () => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        const error = chrome.runtime.lastError;
        if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
          setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo), 50);
        } else {
          console.error(error);
        }
      } else {
        console.log("Success.");
      }
    });
  }

```
### Pass a message to a selected tab's content script

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can communicate with content scripts in specific browser tabs using `tabs.sendMessage()`.

```
function sendMessageToActiveTab(message) {
  const [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true });
  const response = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, message);
  // TODO: Do something with the response.
}

```

## Types

### MutedInfo

Chrome 46+

The tab's muted state and the reason for the last state change.

#### Properties

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension that changed the muted state. Not set if an extension was not the reason the muted state last changed.
* muted

  boolean

  Whether the tab is muted (prevented from playing sound). The tab may be muted even if it has not played or is not currently playing sound. Equivalent to whether the 'muted' audio indicator is showing.
* reason

  The reason the tab was muted or unmuted. Not set if the tab's mute state has never been changed.
### MutedInfoReason

Chrome 46+

An event that caused a muted state change.

#### Enum

"user"   
 A user input action set the muted state.

"capture"   
 Tab capture was started, forcing a muted state change.

"extension"   
 An extension, identified by the extensionId field, set the muted state.

### Tab

#### Properties

* active

  boolean

  Whether the tab is active in its window. Does not necessarily mean the window is focused.

### ZoomSettings

Defines how zoom changes in a tab are handled and at what scope.

#### Properties

* defaultZoomFactor

  number optional

  Chrome 43+

  Used to return the default zoom level for the current tab in calls to tabs.getZoomSettings.
* mode

  [ZoomSettingsMode](#type-ZoomSettingsMode) optional

  Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.
* scope

  [ZoomSettingsScope](#type-ZoomSettingsScope) optional

  Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.
### ZoomSettingsMode

Chrome 44+

Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.

#### Enum

"automatic"   
 Zoom changes are handled automatically by the browser.

"manual"   
 Overrides the automatic handling of zoom changes. The `onZoomChange` event will still be dispatched, and it is the extension's responsibility to listen for this event and manually scale the page. This mode does not support `per-origin` zooming, and thus ignores the `scope` zoom setting and assumes `per-tab`.

"disabled"   
 Disables all zooming in the tab. The tab reverts to the default zoom level, and all attempted zoom changes are ignored.

### ZoomSettingsScope

Chrome 44+

Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.

#### Enum

"per-origin"   
 Zoom changes persist in the zoomed page's origin, i.e., all other tabs navigated to that same origin are zoomed as well. Moreover, `per-origin` zoom changes are saved with the origin, meaning that when navigating to other pages in the same origin, they are all zoomed to the same zoom factor. The `per-origin` scope is only available in the `automatic` mode.

"per-tab"   
 Zoom changes only take effect in this tab, and zoom changes in other tabs do not affect the zooming of this tab. Also, `per-tab` zoom changes are reset on navigation; navigating a tab always loads pages with their `per-origin` zoom factors.

## Properties

### MAX\_CAPTURE\_VISIBLE\_TAB\_CALLS\_PER\_SECOND

Chrome 92+

The maximum number of times that [`captureVisibleTab`](#method-captureVisibleTab) can be called per second. [`captureVisibleTab`](#method-captureVisibleTab) is expensive and should not be called too often.

#### Value

2   

### TAB\_ID\_NONE

Chrome 46+

An ID that represents the absence of a browser tab.

#### Value

-1   

### TAB\_INDEX\_NONE

Chrome 123+

An index that represents the absence of a tab index in a tab\_strip.

#### Value

-1   

## Methods

### captureVisibleTab()

Promise

```
chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(  
  windowId?: number,  
  options?: [ImageDetails](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes/#type-ImageDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Captures the visible area of the currently active tab in the specified window. In order to call this method, the extension must have either the [<all\_urls>](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) permission or the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission. In addition to sites that extensions can normally access, this method allows extensions to capture sensitive sites that are otherwise restricted, including chrome:-scheme pages, other extensions' pages, and data: URLs. These sensitive sites can only be captured with the activeTab permission. File URLs may be captured only if the extension has been granted file access.

#### Parameters

* windowId

  number optional

  The target window. Defaults to the [current window](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/windows/#current-window).
* options

  [ImageDetails](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes/#type-ImageDetails) optional
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (dataUrl: string) => void
  ```

  + dataUrl

    string

    A data URL that encodes an image of the visible area of the captured tab. May be assigned to the 'src' property of an HTML `img` element for display.
#### Returns

* Promise<string>

  Chrome 88+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### connect()

```
chrome.tabs.connect(  
  tabId: number,  
  connectInfo?: object,  
)
```

Connects to the content script(s) in the specified tab. The [`runtime.onConnect`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#event-onConnect) event is fired in each content script running in the specified tab for the current extension. For more details, see [Content Script Messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/messaging).

#### Parameters

* tabId

  number
* connectInfo

  object optional

  + documentId

    string optional

    Chrome 106+

# chrome.tts  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts

# chrome.tts

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.tts` API to play synthesized text-to-speech (TTS). See also the related [`ttsEngine`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/ttsEngine/) API, which allows an extension to implement a speech engine.

Chrome provides this capability on Windows (using SAPI 5), Mac OS X, and ChromeOS, using
speech synthesis capabilities provided by the operating system. On all platforms, the user can
install extensions that register themselves as alternative speech engines.

## Permissions

`tts`  
## Concepts and usage

### Generate speech

Call `speak()` from your extension to speak. For example:

```
chrome.tts.speak('Hello, world.');

```

To stop speaking immediately, just call `stop()`:

```
chrome.tts.stop();

```

You can provide options that control various properties of the speech, such as its rate, pitch, and
more. For example:

```
chrome.tts.speak('Hello, world.', {'rate': 2.0});

```

It's also a good idea to specify the language so that a synthesizer supporting that language (and
regional dialect, if applicable) is chosen.

```
chrome.tts.speak('Hello, world.', {'lang': 'en-US', 'rate': 2.0});

```

By default, each call to `speak()` interrupts any ongoing speech and speaks immediately. To
determine if a call would be interrupting anything, you can call `isSpeaking()`. In addition, you
can use the `enqueue` option to cause this utterance to be added to a queue of utterances that will
be spoken when the current utterance has finished.

```
chrome.tts.speak('Speak this first.');
chrome.tts.speak(
    'Speak this next, when the first sentence is done.', {'enqueue': true});

```

A complete description of all options can be found under [`tts.speak()`](#method-speak). Not all speech
engines will support all options.

To catch errors and make sure you're calling `speak()` correctly, pass a callback function that
takes no arguments. Inside the callback, check [`runtime.lastError`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#property-lastError) to see if there were any
errors.

```
chrome.tts.speak(
  utterance,
  options,
  function() {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      console.log('Error: ' + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
    }
  }
);

```

The callback returns right away, before the engine has started generating speech. The purpose of the
callback is to alert you to syntax errors in your use of the TTS API, not to catch all possible
errors that might occur in the process of synthesizing and outputting speech. To catch these errors
too, you need to use an event listener, described in the next section.

### Listen to events

To get more real-time information about the status of synthesized speech, pass an event listener in
the options to `speak()`, like this:

```
chrome.tts.speak(
  utterance,
  {
    onEvent: function(event) {
      console.log('Event ' + event.type + ' at position ' + event.charIndex);
      if (event.type == 'error') {
        console.log('Error: ' + event.errorMessage);
      }
    }
  },
  callback
);

```

Each event includes an event type, the character index of the current speech relative to the
utterance, and for error events, an optional error message. The event types are:

* `'start'`: The engine has started speaking the utterance.
* `'word'`: A word boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'sentence'`: A sentence boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current
  speech position.
* `'marker'`: An SSML marker was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'end'`: The engine has finished speaking the utterance.
* `'interrupted'`: This utterance was interrupted by another call to `speak()` or `stop()` and did
  not finish.
* `'cancelled'`: This utterance was queued, but then cancelled by another call to `speak()` or
  `stop()` and never began to speak at all.
* `'error'`: An engine-specific error occurred and this utterance cannot be spoken. Check
  `event.errorMessage` for details.

Four of the event types—`'end'`, `'interrupted'`, `'cancelled'`, and `'error'`—are *final*. After
one of those events is received, this utterance will no longer speak and no new events from this
utterance will be received.

Some voices may not support all event types, and some voices may not send any events at all. If you
don't want to use a voice unless it sends certain events, pass the events you require in the
`requiredEventTypes` member of the options object, or use `getVoices()` to choose a voice that meets
your requirements. Both are described in what follows.

### SSML markup

Utterances used in this API may include markup using the [Speech Synthesis Markup Language
(SSML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis). If you use SSML, the first argument to `speak()` should be a complete SSML document with
an XML header and a top-level `<speak>` tag, not a document fragment.

For example:

```
chrome.tts.speak(
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>' +
  '<speak>' +
  '  The <emphasis>second</emphasis> ' +
  '  word of this sentence was emphasized.' +
  '</speak>'
);

```

Not all speech engines will support all SSML tags, and some may not support SSML at all, but all
engines are required to ignore any SSML they don't support and to still speak the underlying text.

### Choose a voice

By default, Chrome chooses the most appropriate voice for each utterance you want to speak, based on
the language. On most Windows, Mac OS X, and ChromeOS systems, speech synthesis provided by the
operating system should be able to speak any text in at least one language. Some users may have a
variety of voices available, though, from their operating system and from speech engines implemented
by other Chrome extensions. In those cases, you can implement custom code to choose the appropriate
voice, or to present the user with a list of choices.

To get a list of all voices, call `getVoices()` and pass it a function that receives an array of
`TtsVoice` objects as its argument:

```
chrome.tts.getVoices(
  function(voices) {
    for (var i = 0; i < voices.length; i++) {
      console.log('Voice ' + i + ':');
      console.log('  name: ' + voices[i].voiceName);
      console.log('  lang: ' + voices[i].lang);
      console.log('  extension id: ' + voices[i].extensionId);
      console.log('  event types: ' + voices[i].eventTypes);
    }
  }
);

```
## Types

### EventType

Chrome 54+

#### Enum

"start"   

"end"   

"word"   

"sentence"   

"marker"   

"interrupted"   

"cancelled"   

"error"   

"pause"   

"resume"   

### TtsEvent

An event from the TTS engine to communicate the status of an utterance.

#### Properties

* charIndex

  number optional

  The index of the current character in the utterance. For word events, the event fires at the end of one word and before the beginning of the next. The `charIndex` represents a point in the text at the beginning of the next word to be spoken.
* errorMessage

  string optional

  The error description, if the event type is `error`.
* length

  number optional

  Chrome 74+

  The length of the next part of the utterance. For example, in a `word` event, this is the length of the word which will be spoken next. It will be set to -1 if not set by the speech engine.
* type

  [EventType](#type-EventType)

  The type can be `start` as soon as speech has started, `word` when a word boundary is reached, `sentence` when a sentence boundary is reached, `marker` when an SSML mark element is reached, `end` when the end of the utterance is reached, `interrupted` when the utterance is stopped or interrupted before reaching the end, `cancelled` when it's removed from the queue before ever being synthesized, or `error` when any other error occurs. When pausing speech, a `pause` event is fired if a particular utterance is paused in the middle, and `resume` if an utterance resumes speech. Note that pause and resume events may not fire if speech is paused in-between utterances.
### TtsOptions

Chrome 77+

The speech options for the TTS engine.

#### Properties

* desiredEventTypes

  string[] optional

  The TTS event types that you are interested in listening to. If missing, all event types may be sent.
* enqueue

  boolean optional

  If true, enqueues this utterance if TTS is already in progress. If false (the default), interrupts any current speech and flushes the speech queue before speaking this new utterance.
* extensionId

  string optional

  The extension ID of the speech engine to use, if known.

Values below 0.1 or above 10.0 are strictly disallowed, but many voices will constrain the minimum and maximum rates further—for example a particular voice may not actually speak faster than 3 times normal even if you specify a value larger than 3.0.
* requiredEventTypes

  string[] optional

  The TTS event types the voice must support.
* voiceName

  string optional

  The name of the voice to use for synthesis. If empty, uses any available voice.

  The `onEvent` function looks like:
  ```
  (event: [TtsEvent](#type-TtsEvent)) => {...}
  ```

  + event

    [TtsEvent](#type-TtsEvent)

    The update event from the text-to-speech engine indicating the status of this utterance.

# chrome.ttsEngine

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.ttsEngine` API to implement a text-to-speech(TTS) engine using an extension. If your extension registers using this API, it will receive events containing an utterance to be spoken and other parameters when any extension or Chrome App uses the [`tts`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tts/) API to generate speech. Your extension can then use any available web technology to synthesize and output the speech, and send events back to the calling function to report the status.

## Permissions

`ttsEngine`  
## Concepts and usage

An extension can register itself as a speech engine. By doing so, it can intercept some or all calls
to functions such as [`tts.speak()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts#method-speak) and [`tts.stop()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts#method-stop) and provide an alternate implementation.
Extensions are free to use any available web technology to provide speech, including streaming audio
from a server, HTML5 audio. An extension could even do something different
with the utterances, like display closed captions in a popup or send them as log messages to
a remote server.

To implement a TTS engine, an extension must declare the "ttsEngine" permission and then declare all
voices it provides in the extension manifest, like this:

```
{
  "name": "My TTS Engine",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["ttsEngine"],
  "tts_engine": {
    "voices": [
      {
        "voice_name": "Alice",
        "lang": "en-US",
        "event_types": ["start", "marker", "end"]
      },
      {
        "voice_name": "Pat",
        "lang": "en-US",
        "event_types": ["end"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "background": {
    "page": "background.html",
    "persistent": false
  }
}

```

An extension can specify any number of voices.

The `voice_name` parameter is required. The name should be descriptive enough that it identifies the
name of the voice and the engine used. In the unlikely event that two extensions register voices
with the same name, a client can specify the ID of the extension that should do the synthesis.

The `lang` parameter is optional, but highly recommended. Almost always, a voice can synthesize
speech in just a single language. When an engine supports more than one language, it can easily
register a separate voice for each language. Under rare circumstances where a single voice can
handle more than one language, it's easiest to just list two separate voices and handle them using
the same logic internally. However, if you want to create a voice that will handle utterances in any
language, leave out the `lang` parameter from your extension's manifest.

Finally, the `event_types` parameter is required if the engine can send events to update the client
on the progress of speech synthesis. At a minimum, supporting the `'end'` event type to indicate
when speech is finished is highly recommended, otherwise Chrome cannot schedule queued utterances.

Once loaded, an extension can replace the list of declared voices by calling
`chrome.ttsEngine.updateVoices`. (Note that the parameters used in the programatic call to
`updateVoices` are in camel case: e.g., `voiceName`, unlike the manifest file which uses
`voice_name`.)

The possible event types that you can send correspond to the event types that the `speak()` method
receives:

* `'start'`: The engine has started speaking the utterance.
* `'word'`: A word boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'sentence'`: A sentence boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current
  speech position.
* `'marker'`: An SSML marker was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'end'`: The engine has finished speaking the utterance.
* `'error'`: An engine-specific error occurred and this utterance cannot be spoken. Pass more
  information in `event.errorMessage`.

The `'interrupted'` and `'cancelled'` events are not sent by the speech engine; they are generated
automatically by Chrome.

Text-to-speech clients can get the voice information from your extension's manifest by calling
[`tts.getVoices`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts#method-getVoices), assuming you've registered speech event listeners as described below.

### Handle speech events

To generate speech at the request of clients, your extension must register listeners for both
`onSpeak` and `onStop`, like this:

```
const speakListener = (utterance, options, sendTtsEvent) => {
  sendTtsEvent({type: 'start', charIndex: 0})

  // (start speaking)

  sendTtsEvent({type: 'end', charIndex: utterance.length})
};

const stopListener = () => {
  // (stop all speech)
};

chrome.ttsEngine.onSpeak.addListener(speakListener);
chrome.ttsEngine.onStop.addListener(stopListener);

```

The decision of whether or not to send a given speech request to an extension is based solely on
whether the extension supports the given voice parameters in its manifest and has registered
listeners for `onSpeak` and `onStop`. In other words, there's no way for an extension to receive a
speech request and dynamically decide whether to handle it.

## Types

### AudioBuffer

#### Properties

* audioBuffer

  ArrayBuffer

  number optional

  The character index associated with this audio buffer.
* isLastBuffer

  boolean optional

  True if this audio buffer is the last for the text being spoken.

  The install status of the language.
### updateVoices()

Chrome 66+

```
chrome.ttsEngine.updateVoices(  
  voices: [TtsVoice](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tts/#type-TtsVoice)[],  
)
```

Called by an engine to update its list of voices. This list overrides any voices declared in this extension's manifest.

#### Parameters

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSpeak

```
chrome.ttsEngine.onSpeak.addListener(

# chrome.types  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/types

# chrome.types

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The `chrome.types` API contains type declarations for Chrome.

## Chrome settings

The [`ChromeSetting`](#type-ChromeSetting) type provides a common set of functions (`get()`, `set()`, and `clear()`)
as well as an event publisher (`onChange`) for settings of the Chrome browser. The [proxy settings
examples](/docs/extensions/reference/api/proxy#examples) demonstrate how these functions are intended to be used.

### Scope and lifecycle

Chrome distinguishes between three different scopes of browser settings:

`regular`
Settings set in the `regular` scope apply to regular browser windows and are inherited by incognito
windows if they are not overwritten. These settings are stored to disk and remain in place until
they are cleared by the governing extension, or the governing extension is disabled or uninstalled.
`incognito_persistent`
Settings set in the `incognito_persistent` scope apply only to incognito windows. For these, they
override `regular` settings. These settings are stored to disk and remain in place until they are
cleared by the governing extension, or the governing extension is disabled or uninstalled.
`incognito_session_only`
Settings set in the `incognito_session_only` scope apply only to incognito windows. For these, they
override `regular` and `incognito_persistent` settings. These settings are not stored to disk and
are cleared when the last incognito window is closed. They can only be set when at least one
incognito window is open.
### Precedence

Chrome manages settings on different layers. The following list describes the layers that may
influence the effective settings, in increasing order of precedence.

1. System settings provided by the operating system
2. Command-line parameters
3. Settings provided by extensions
4. Policies

As the list implies, policies might overrule any changes that you specify with your extension. You
can use the `get()` function to determine whether your extension is capable of providing a setting
or whether this setting would be overridden.

As discussed previously, Chrome allows using different settings for regular windows and incognito
windows. The following example illustrates the behavior. Assume that no policy overrides the
settings and that an extension can set settings for regular windows **(R)** and settings for
incognito windows **(I)**.

* If only **(R)** is set, these settings are effective for both regular and incognito windows.
* If only **(I)** is set, these settings are effective for only incognito windows. Regular windows
  use the settings determined by the lower layers (command-line options and system settings).
* If both **(R)** and **(I)** are set, the respective settings are used for regular and incognito
  windows.

If two or more extensions want to set the same setting to different values, the extension installed
most recently takes precedence over the other extensions. If the most recently installed extension
sets only **(I)**, the settings of regular windows can be defined by previously installed
extensions.

The *effective* value of a setting is the one that results from considering the precedence rules. It
is used by Chrome.

## Types

### ChromeSetting

An interface that allows access to a Chrome browser setting. See [`accessibilityFeatures`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/accessibilityFeatures/) for an example.

# chrome.userScripts  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/userScripts

# chrome.userScripts

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `userScripts` API to execute user scripts in the User Scripts context.

## Permissions

`userScripts`  

To use the `chrome.userScripts` API, add the `"userScripts"` permission to your manifest.json and `"host_permissions"` for sites you want to run scripts on.

```
{
  "name": "User script test extension",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "minimum_chrome_version": "120",
  "permissions": [
    "userScripts"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://example.com/*"
  ]
}

```
## Availability

Chrome 120+
MV3+

## Concepts and usage

A user script is a bit of code injected into a web page to modify its appearance or behavior. Scripts are either created by users or downloaded from a script repository or a user script extension.

### Developer mode for extension users

As an extension developer, you already have Developer mode enabled in your installation of Chrome. For user script extensions, your users will also need to enable developer mode. Here are instructions that you can copy and paste into your own documentation.

1. Go to the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions` in a new tab. (By design `chrome://` URLs are not linkable.)
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.

   Extensions page (chrome://extensions)

You can determine if developer mode is enabled by checking whether `chrome.userScripts` throws an error. For example:

```
function isUserScriptsAvailable() {
  try {
    // Property access which throws if developer mode is not enabled.
    chrome.userScripts;
    return true;
  } catch {
    // Not available.
    return false;
  }
}

```
### Work in isolated worlds

Both user and content scripts can run in an isolated world or in the main world. An isolated world is an execution environment that isn't accessible to a host page or other extensions. This lets a user script change its JavaScript environment without affecting the host page or other extensions' user and content scripts. Conversely, user scripts (and content scripts) are not visible to the host page or the user and content scripts of other extensions. Scripts running in the main world are accessible to host pages and other extensions and are visible to host pages and to other extensions. To select the world, pass `"USER_SCRIPT"` or `"MAIN"` when calling [`userScripts.register()`](#method-register).

To configure a [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) for the `USER_SCRIPT` world, call `userScripts.configureWorld()`:

```
chrome.userScripts.configureWorld({
  csp: "script-src 'self'"
});

```
### Messaging

Like content scripts and offscreen documents, user scripts communicate with other parts of an extension using [messaging](/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging) (meaning they can call `runtime.sendMessage()` and `runtime.connect()` as any other part of an extension would). However, they're received using dedicated event handlers (meaning, they don't use `onMessage` or `onConnect`). These handlers are called [`runtime.onUserScriptMessage`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#event-onUserScriptMessage) and [`runtime.onUserScriptConnect`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#event-onUserScriptConnect). Dedicated handlers make it easier to identify messages from user scripts, which are a less-trusted context.

Before sending a message, you must call [`configureWorld()`](#method-configureWorld) with the `messaging` argument set to `true`. Note that both the `csp` and `messaging` arguments can be passed at the same time.

```
chrome.userScripts.configureWorld({
  messaging: true
});

```
### Extension updates

User scripts are cleared when an extension updates. You can add them back by running code in the [`runtime.onInstalled`](/docs/extensions/reference/runtime#event-onInstalled) event handler in the extension service worker. Respond only to the [`"update"` reason](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#type-OnInstalledReason:%7E:text=as%20an%20installation.-,%22update%22,-Specifies%20the%20event) passed to the event callback.

## Example

This example is from the [userScript sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/userScripts) in our samples repository.

### Register a script

The following example shows a basic call to `register()`. The first argument is an array of objects defining the scripts to be registered. There are more options than are shown here.

```
chrome.userScripts.register([{
  id: 'test',
  matches: ['*://*/*'],
  js: [{code: 'alert("Hi!")'}]
}]);

```
## Types

### ExecutionWorld

The JavaScript world for a user script to execute within.

#### Enum

"MAIN"   
 Specifies the execution environment of the DOM, which is the execution environment shared with the host page's JavaScript.

"USER\_SCRIPT"   
 Specifies the execution environment that is specific to user scripts and is exempt from the page's CSP.

### RegisteredUserScript

#### Properties

  boolean optional

  If true, it will inject into all frames, even if the frame is not the top-most frame in the tab. Each frame is checked independently for URL requirements; it will not inject into child frames if the URL requirements are not met. Defaults to false, meaning that only the top frame is matched.
* excludeGlobs

  string[] optional

  Specifies wildcard patterns for pages this user script will NOT be injected into.
* excludeMatches

  string[] optional

  Excludes pages that this user script would otherwise be injected into. See [Match Patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns) for more details on the syntax of these strings.
* id

  string

  The ID of the user script specified in the API call. This property must not start with a '\_' as it's reserved as a prefix for generated script IDs.
* includeGlobs

  string[] optional

  Specifies wildcard patterns for pages this user script will be injected into.
* js

  [ScriptSource](#type-ScriptSource)[] optional

  The list of ScriptSource objects defining sources of scripts to be injected into matching pages. This property must be specified for ${ref:register}, and when specified it must be a non-empty array.
* matches

  string[] optional

  Specifies which pages this user script will be injected into. See [Match Patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns) for more details on the syntax of these strings. This property must be specified for ${ref:register}.
* runAt

  [RunAt](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/extensionTypes/#type-RunAt) optional

  Specifies when JavaScript files are injected into the web page. The preferred and default value is `document_idle`.
* world

  [ExecutionWorld](#type-ExecutionWorld) optional

  The JavaScript execution environment to run the script in. The default is ``USER_SCRIPT``.
* worldId

  string optional

  Pending

  If specified, specifies a specific user script world ID to execute in. Only valid if `world` is omitted or is `USER_SCRIPT`. If omitted, the script will execute in the default user script world. Values with leading underscores (`_`) are reserved.
### ScriptSource

#### Properties

* code

  string optional

  A string containing the JavaScript code to inject. Exactly one of `file` or `code` must be specified.
* file

  string optional

  The path of the JavaScript file to inject relative to the extension's root directory. Exactly one of `file` or `code` must be specified.
### UserScriptFilter

#### Properties

* ids

  string[] optional

  [`getScripts`](#method-getScripts) only returns scripts with the IDs specified in this list.
### WorldProperties

#### Properties

* csp

  string optional

  Specifies the world csp. The default is the ``ISOLATED`` world csp.
* messaging

  boolean optional

  Specifies whether messaging APIs are exposed. The default is `false`.

# chrome.vpnProvider  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/vpnProvider

# chrome.vpnProvider

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.vpnProvider` API to implement a VPN client.

## Permissions

`vpnProvider`  
## Availability

Chrome 43+
ChromeOS only

## Concepts and usage

Typical usage of `chrome.vpnProvider` is as follows:

* Create VPN configurations by calling [`createConfig()`](#method-createConfig). A VPN configuration is a persistent entry shown to the user in a ChromeOS UI. The user can select a VPN configuration from a list and connect to it or disconnect from it.
* Add listeners to the [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage), [`onPacketReceived`](#event-onPacketReceived), and [`onConfigRemoved`](#event-onConfigRemoved) events.
* When the user connects to the VPN configuration, [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage) will be received with the message `"connected"`. The period between the `"connected"` and `"disconnected"` messages is called a "VPN session". In this time period, the extension that receives the message is said to own the VPN session.
* Initiate connection to the VPN server and start the VPN client.
* Set the Parameters of the connection by calling [`setParameters()`](#method-setParameters).
* Notify the connection state as `"connected"` by calling [`notifyConnectionStateChanged()`](#method-notifyConnectionStateChanged).
* When the steps previous are completed without errors, a virtual tunnel is created to the network stack of ChromeOS. IP packets can be sent through the tunnel by calling [`sendPacket()`](#method-sendPacket) and any packets originating on the ChromeOS device will be received using the [`onPacketReceived`](#event-onPacketReceived) event handler.
* When the user disconnects from the VPN configuration, [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage) will be fired with the message `"disconnected"`.
* If the VPN configuration is no longer necessary, it can be destroyed by calling [`destroyConfig()`](#method-destroyConfig).

## Types

### Parameters

#### Properties

* address

  string

  IP address for the VPN interface in CIDR notation. IPv4 is currently the only supported mode.
* broadcastAddress

  string optional

  Broadcast address for the VPN interface. (default: deduced from IP address and mask)
* dnsServers

  string[]

  A list of IPs for the DNS servers.
* domainSearch

  string[] optional

  A list of search domains. (default: no search domain)
* exclusionList

  string[]

  Exclude network traffic to the list of IP blocks in CIDR notation from the tunnel. This can be used to bypass traffic to and from the VPN server. When many rules match a destination, the rule with the longest matching prefix wins. Entries that correspond to the same CIDR block are treated as duplicates. Such duplicates in the collated (exclusionList + inclusionList) list are eliminated and the exact duplicate entry that will be eliminated is undefined.
* inclusionList

  string[]

  Include network traffic to the list of IP blocks in CIDR notation to the tunnel. This parameter can be used to set up a split tunnel. By default no traffic is directed to the tunnel. Adding the entry "0.0.0.0/0" to this list gets all the user traffic redirected to the tunnel. When many rules match a destination, the rule with the longest matching prefix wins. Entries that correspond to the same CIDR block are treated as duplicates. Such duplicates in the collated (exclusionList + inclusionList) list are eliminated and the exact duplicate entry that will be eliminated is undefined.
* mtu

  string optional

  MTU setting for the VPN interface. (default: 1500 bytes)
* reconnect

  string optional

  Chrome 51+

  Whether or not the VPN extension implements auto-reconnection.

  If true, the `linkDown`, `linkUp`, `linkChanged`, `suspend`, and `resume` platform messages will be used to signal the respective events. If false, the system will forcibly disconnect the VPN if the network topology changes, and the user will need to reconnect manually. (default: false)

  This property is new in Chrome 51; it will generate an exception in earlier versions. try/catch can be used to conditionally enable the feature based on browser support.
### PlatformMessage

The enum is used by the platform to notify the client of the VPN session status.

#### Enum

"connected"   
 Indicates that the VPN configuration connected.

"disconnected"   
 Indicates that the VPN configuration disconnected.

"error"   
 Indicates that an error occurred in VPN connection, for example a timeout. A description of the error is given as the error argument to onPlatformMessage.

"linkDown"   
 Indicates that the default physical network connection is down.

"linkUp"   
 Indicates that the default physical network connection is back up.

"linkChanged"   
 Indicates that the default physical network connection changed, e.g. wifi->mobile.

"suspend"   
 Indicates that the OS is preparing to suspend, so the VPN should drop its connection. The extension is not guaranteed to receive this event prior to suspending.

"resume"   
 Indicates that the OS has resumed and the user has logged back in, so the VPN should try to reconnect.

### UIEvent

The enum is used by the platform to indicate the event that triggered `onUIEvent`.

#### Enum

"showAddDialog"   
 Requests that the VPN client show the add configuration dialog box to the user.

"showConfigureDialog"   
 Requests that the VPN client show the configuration settings dialog box to the user.

### VpnConnectionState

The enum is used by the VPN client to inform the platform of its current state. This helps provide meaningful messages to the user.

#### Enum

"connected"   
 Specifies that VPN connection was successful.

"failure"   
 Specifies that VPN connection has failed.

## Methods

`webAuthenticationProxy`  
## Availability

Chrome 115+
MV3+

## Types

### CreateRequest

#### Properties

* requestDetailsJson

  string

  The `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` passed to `navigator.credentials.create()`, serialized as a JSON string. The serialization format is compatible with [`PublicKeyCredential.parseCreationOptionsFromJSON()`](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-parseCreationOptionsFromJSON).

## Methods

### attach()

Promise

```
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.attach(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Makes this extension the active Web Authentication API request proxy.

Remote desktop extensions typically call this method after detecting attachment of a remote session to this host. Once this method returns without error, regular processing of WebAuthn requests is suspended, and events from this extension API are raised.

This method fails with an error if a different extension is already attached.

The attached extension must call `detach()` once the remote desktop session has ended in order to resume regular WebAuthn request processing. Extensions automatically become detached if they are unloaded.

Refer to the `onRemoteSessionStateChange` event for signaling a change of remote session attachment from a native application to to the (possibly suspended) extension.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (error?: string) => void
  ```

  + error

    string optional
#### Returns

* Promise<string | undefined>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### completeCreateRequest()

Promise

```
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.completeCreateRequest(  
  details: [CreateResponseDetails](#type-CreateResponseDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Reports the result of a `navigator.credentials.create()` call. The extension must call this for every `onCreateRequest` event it has received, unless the request was canceled (in which case, an `onRequestCanceled` event is fired).

#### Parameters

```

Removes this extension from being the active Web Authentication API request proxy.

This method is typically called when the extension detects that a remote desktop session was terminated. Once this method returns, the extension ceases to be the active Web Authentication API request proxy.

Refer to the `onRemoteSessionStateChange` event for signaling a change of remote session attachment from a native application to to the (possibly suspended) extension.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (error?: string) => void
  ```

  + error

    string optional
#### Returns

* Promise<string | undefined>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onCreateRequest

```
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onCreateRequest.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fires when a WebAuthn `navigator.credentials.create()` call occurs. The extension must supply a response by calling `completeCreateRequest()` with the `requestId` from `requestInfo`.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (requestInfo: [CreateRequest](#type-CreateRequest)) => void
  ```

  + requestInfo

    [CreateRequest](#type-CreateRequest)
### onGetRequest

```
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onGetRequest.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fires when a WebAuthn navigator.credentials.get() call occurs. The extension must supply a response by calling `completeGetRequest()` with the `requestId` from `requestInfo`

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (requestInfo: [GetRequest](#type-GetRequest)) => void
  ```

  + requestInfo

    [GetRequest](#type-GetRequest)
### onIsUvpaaRequest

```
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onIsUvpaaRequest.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fires when a `PublicKeyCredential.isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable()` call occurs. The extension must supply a response by calling `completeIsUvpaaRequest()` with the `requestId` from `requestInfo`

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (requestInfo: [IsUvpaaRequest](#type-IsUvpaaRequest)) => void
  ```

  + requestInfo

    [IsUvpaaRequest](#type-IsUvpaaRequest)
### onRemoteSessionStateChange

```
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onRemoteSessionStateChange.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

A native application associated with this extension can cause this event to be fired by writing to a file with a name equal to the extension's ID in a directory named `WebAuthenticationProxyRemoteSessionStateChange` inside the [default user data directory](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/user_data_dir.md#default-location)

The contents of the file should be empty. I.e., it is not necessary to change the contents of the file in order to trigger this event.

The native host application may use this event mechanism to signal a possible remote session state change (i.e. from detached to attached, or vice versa) while the extension service worker is possibly suspended. In the handler for this event, the extension can call the `attach()` or `detach()` API methods accordingly.

The event listener must be registered synchronously at load time.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onRequestCanceled

```
chrome.webAuthenticationProxy.onRequestCanceled.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fires when a `onCreateRequest` or `onGetRequest` event is canceled (because the WebAuthn request was aborted by the caller, or because it timed out). When receiving this event, the extension should cancel processing of the corresponding request on the client side. Extensions cannot complete a request once it has been canceled.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (requestId: number) => void
  ```

  + requestId

    number

# chrome.webNavigation

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.webNavigation` API to receive notifications about the status of navigation requests in-flight.

## Permissions

`webNavigation`  

All `chrome.webNavigation` methods and events require you to declare the `"webNavigation"` permission
in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "webNavigation"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Event order

For a navigation that is successfully completed, events are fired in the following order:

```
onBeforeNavigate -> onCommitted -> [onDOMContentLoaded] -> onCompleted

```

Any error that occurs during the process results in an `onErrorOccurred` event. For a specific
navigation, there are no further events fired after `onErrorOccurred`.

If a navigating frame contains subframes, its `onCommitted` is fired before any of its children's
`onBeforeNavigate`; while `onCompleted` is fired after all of its children's `onCompleted`.

If the reference fragment of a frame is changed, a `onReferenceFragmentUpdated` event is fired. This
event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`, even after `onCompleted`.

If the history API is used to modify the state of a frame (e.g. using `history.pushState()`, a
`onHistoryStateUpdated` event is fired. This event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`.

If a navigation restored a page from the [Back Forward Cache](https://web.dev/bfcache/), the `onDOMContentLoaded` event
won't fire. The event is not fired because the content has already completed load when the page
was first visited.

If a navigation was triggered using [Chrome Instant](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/177873) or [Instant Pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029), a completely loaded
page is swapped into the current tab. In that case, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired.

### Relation to webRequest events

There is no defined ordering between events of the [webRequest API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest) and the events of the
webNavigation API. It is possible that webRequest events are still received for frames that already
started a new navigation, or that a navigation only proceeds after the network resources are already
fully loaded.

In general, the webNavigation events are closely related to the navigation state that is displayed
in the UI, while the webRequest events correspond to the state of the network stack which is
generally opaque to the user.

### Tab IDs

Not all navigating tabs correspond to actual tabs in Chrome's UI, for example, a tab that is being
pre-rendered. Such tabs are not accessible using the [tabs API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs) nor can you request information
about them by calling `webNavigation.getFrame()` or `webNavigation.getAllFrames()`. Once such a tab
is swapped in, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired and they become accessible through these APIs.

### Timestamps

It's important to note that some technical oddities in the OS's handling of distinct Chrome
processes can cause the clock to be skewed between the browser itself and extension processes. That
means that the `timeStamp` property of the `WebNavigation` event `timeStamp` property is only guaranteed
to be *internally* consistent. Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct offset
between them, but comparing them to the current time inside the extension (using `(new Date()).getTime()`,
for instance) might give unexpected results.

### Frame IDs

Frames within a tab can be identified by a frame ID. The frame ID of the main frame is always 0, the
ID of child frames is a positive number. Once a document is constructed in a frame, its frame ID
remains constant during the lifetime of the document. As of Chrome 49, this ID is also constant for
the lifetime of the frame (across multiple navigations).

Due to the multi-process nature of Chrome, a tab might use different processes to render the source
and destination of a web page. Therefore, if a navigation takes place in a new process, you might
receive events both from the new and the old page until the new navigation is committed (i.e. the
`onCommitted` event is sent for the new main frame). In other words, it is possible to have more
than one pending sequence of webNavigation events with the same `frameId`. The sequences can be
distinguished by the `processId` key.

Also note that during a provisional load the process might be switched several times. This happens
when the load is redirected to a different site. In this case, you will receive repeated
`onBeforeNavigate` and `onErrorOccurred` events, until you receive the final `onCommitted` event.

Another concept that is problematic with extensions is the lifecycle of the
frame. A frame hosts a document (which is associated with a committed URL).
The document can change (say by navigating) but the *frameId* won't, and so it
is difficult to associate that something happened in a specific document with
just *frameIds*. We are introducing a concept of a [documentId](/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation#method-getFrame:%7E:text=retrieve%20information%20about.-,documentId,-string%C2%A0optional)
which is a unique identifier per document. If a frame is navigated and opens a
new document the identifier will change. This field is useful for determining
when pages change their lifecycle state (between prerender/active/cached)
because it remains the same.

### Transition types and qualifiers

The `webNavigation` `onCommitted` event has a `transitionType` and a `transitionQualifiers`
property. The *transition type* is the same as used in the [history API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/history#transition_types) describing how the
browser navigated to this particular URL. In addition, several *transition qualifiers* can be
returned that further define the navigation.

The following transition qualifiers exist:

| Transition qualifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "client\_redirect" | One or more redirects caused by JavaScript or meta refresh tags on the page happened during the navigation. |
| "server\_redirect" | One or more redirects caused by HTTP headers sent from the server happened during the navigation. |
| "forward\_back" | The user used the Forward or Back button to initiate the navigation. |
| "from\_address\_bar" | The user initiated the navigation from the address bar (aka Omnibox). |

## Examples

To try this API, install the [webNavigation API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/webNavigation) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

Chrome 44+

#### Enum

"client\_redirect"   

"server\_redirect"

# chrome.webRequest

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.webRequest` API to observe and analyze traffic and to intercept, block, or modify requests in-flight.

## Permissions

`webRequest`  

You must declare the `"webRequest"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use the web request
API, along with the necessary [host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions). To intercept a sub-resource request, the
extension must have access to both the requested URL and its initiator. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "webRequest"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.google.com/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```

`webRequestBlocking`

Required to register blocking event handlers. As of Manifest V3, this is only
available to policy installed extensions.

`webRequestAuthProvider`

Required to use the [`onAuthRequired`](#event-onAuthRequired) method. See
[Handling authentication](#handle-auth).

## Concepts and usage

### Life cycle of requests

The web request API defines a set of events that follow the life cycle of a web request. You can use
these events to observe and analyze traffic. Certain synchronous events will allow you to intercept,
block, or modify a request.

The event life cycle for successful requests is illustrated here, followed by event definitions:

`onBeforeRequest` (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request is about to occur. This event is sent before any TCP connection is made and can
be used to cancel or redirect requests.
`onBeforeSendHeaders` (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request is about to occur and the initial headers have been prepared. The event is
intended to allow extensions to add, modify, and delete request headers [(\*)](#life_cycle_footnote). The
`onBeforeSendHeaders` event is passed to all subscribers, so different subscribers may attempt to
modify the request; see the [Implementation details](#implementation-details) section for how this is handled. This event
can be used to cancel the request.
`onSendHeaders`
Fires after all extensions have had a chance to modify the request headers, and presents the final
[(\*)](#life_cycle_footnote) version. The event is triggered before the headers are sent to the network. This event is
informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow modifying or cancelling the request.
`onHeadersReceived` (optionally synchronous)
Fires each time that an HTTP(S) response header is received. Due to redirects and authentication
requests this can happen multiple times per request. This event is intended to allow extensions to
add, modify, and delete response headers, such as incoming Content-Type headers. The caching
directives are processed before this event is triggered, so modifying headers such as Cache-Control
has no influence on the browser's cache. It also allows you to cancel or redirect the request.
`onAuthRequired` (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request requires authentication of the user. This event can be handled synchronously to
provide authentication credentials. Note that extensions may provide invalid credentials. Take care
not to enter an infinite loop by repeatedly providing invalid credentials. This can also be used to
cancel the request.
`onBeforeRedirect`
Fires when a redirect is about to be executed. A redirection can be triggered by an HTTP response
code or by an extension. This event is informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow
you to modify or cancel the request.
`onResponseStarted`
Fires when the first byte of the response body is received. For HTTP requests, this means that the
status line and response headers are available. This event is informational and handled
asynchronously. It does not allow modifying or canceling the request.
`onCompleted`
Fires when a request has been processed successfully.
`onErrorOccurred`
Fires when a request could not be processed successfully.

The web request API guarantees that for each request, either `onCompleted` or `onErrorOccurred` is
fired as the final event with one exception: If a request is redirected to a `data://` URL,
`onBeforeRedirect` is the last reported event.

\*
Note that the web request API presents an abstraction of the network stack to the extension.
Internally, one URL request can be split into several HTTP requests (for example, to fetch individual
byte ranges from a large file) or can be handled by the network stack without communicating with the
network. For this reason, the API does not provide the final HTTP headers that are sent to the
network. For example, all headers that are related to caching are invisible to the extension.

The following headers are currently **not provided** to the `onBeforeSendHeaders` event. This list
is not guaranteed to be complete or stable.

* Authorization
* Cache-Control
* Connection
* Content-Length
* Host
* If-Modified-Since
* If-None-Match
* If-Range
* Partial-Data
* Pragma
* Proxy-Authorization
* Proxy-Connection
* Transfer-Encoding

Starting from Chrome 79, request header modifications affect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
checks. If modified headers for cross-origin requests do not meet the criteria, it will result in
sending a CORS preflight to ask the server if such headers can be accepted. If you really need to
modify headers in a way to violate the CORS protocol, you need to specify `'extraHeaders'` in
`opt_extraInfoSpec`. On the other hand, response header modifications do not work to deceive CORS
checks. If you need to deceive the CORS protocol, you also need to specify `'extraHeaders'` for the
response modifications.

Starting from Chrome 79, the webRequest API **does not** intercept CORS preflight requests and
responses by default. A CORS preflight for a request URL is visible to an extension if there is a
listener with `'extraHeaders'` specified in `opt_extraInfoSpec` for the request URL.
`onBeforeRequest` can also take `'extraHeaders'` from Chrome 79.

Starting from Chrome 79, the following request header is **not provided** and cannot be modified or
removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`:

* Origin

Starting from Chrome 72, if you need to modify responses before [Cross Origin Read Blocking
(CORB)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/services/network/cross_origin_read_blocking_explainer.md) can block the response, you need to specify `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`.

Starting from Chrome 72, the following request headers are **not provided** and cannot be modified
or removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`:

* Accept-Language
* Accept-Encoding
* Referer
* Cookie

Starting from Chrome 72, the `Set-Cookie` response header is **not provided** and cannot be modified
or removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`.

Starting from Chrome 89, the `X-Frame-Options` response header cannot be effectively modified
or removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`.

The webRequest API only exposes requests that the extension has permission to see, given its [host
permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions). Moreover, only the following schemes are accessible: `http://`, `https://`,
`ftp://`, `file://`, `ws://` (since Chrome 58), `wss://` (since Chrome 58), `urn:` (since Chrome 91), or
`chrome-extension://`. In addition, even certain requests with URLs using one of the above schemes
are hidden. These include `chrome-extension://other_extension_id` where `other_extension_id` is not
the ID of the extension to handle the request, `https://www.google.com/chrome`, and other sensitive
requests core to browser functionality. Also synchronous XMLHttpRequests from your extension are
hidden from blocking event handlers in order to prevent deadlocks. Note that for some of the
supported schemes the set of available events might be limited due to the nature of the
corresponding protocol. For example, for the file: scheme, only `onBeforeRequest`,
`onResponseStarted`, `onCompleted`, and `onErrorOccurred` may be dispatched.

Starting from Chrome 58, the webRequest API supports intercepting the WebSocket handshake request.
Since the handshake is done by means of an HTTP upgrade request, its flow fits into HTTP-oriented
webRequest model. Note that the API does **not intercept**:

* Individual messages sent over an established WebSocket connection.
* WebSocket closing connection.

Redirects are **not supported** for WebSocket requests.

Starting from Chrome 72, an extension will be able to intercept a request only if it has host
permissions to both the requested URL and the request initiator.

Starting from Chrome 96, the webRequest API supports intercepting the WebTransport over HTTP/3
handshake request. Since the handshake is done by means of an HTTP CONNECT request, its flow fits
into HTTP-oriented webRequest model. Note that:

* Once the session is established, extensions cannot observe or intervene in the session via the
  webRequest API.
* Modifying HTTP request headers in `onBeforeSendHeaders` is ignored.
* Redirects and authentications are **not supported** in WebTransport over HTTP/3.

### Request IDs

Each request is identified by a request ID. This ID is unique within a browser session and the
context of an extension. It remains constant during the life cycle of a request and can be used
to match events for the same request. Note that several HTTP requests are mapped to one web request
in case of HTTP redirection or HTTP authentication.

### Registering event listeners

To register an event listener for a web request, you use a variation on the [usual `addListener()`
function](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events). In addition to specifying a callback function, you have to specify a filter argument, and you may specify an optional extra info argument.

The three arguments to the web request API's `addListener()` have the following definitions:

```
var callback = function(details) {...};
var filter = {...};
var opt_extraInfoSpec = [...];

```

Here's an example of listening for the `onBeforeRequest` event:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
    callback, filter, opt_extraInfoSpec);

```

Each `addListener()` call takes a mandatory callback function as the first parameter. This callback
function is passed a dictionary containing information about the current URL request. The
information in this dictionary depends on the specific event type as well as the content of
`opt_extraInfoSpec`.

If the optional `opt_extraInfoSpec` array contains the string `'blocking'` (only allowed for
specific events), the callback function is handled synchronously. That means that the request is
blocked until the callback function returns. In this case, the callback can return a
[`webRequest.BlockingResponse`](#type-BlockingResponse) that determines the further life cycle of the request. Depending
on the context, this response allows canceling or redirecting a request (`onBeforeRequest`),
canceling a request or modifying headers (`onBeforeSendHeaders`, `onHeadersReceived`), and
canceling a request or providing authentication credentials (`onAuthRequired`).

If the optional `opt_extraInfoSpec` array contains the string `'asyncBlocking'` instead (only
allowed for `onAuthRequired`), the extension can generate the [`webRequest.BlockingResponse`](#type-BlockingResponse)
asynchronously.

The [`webRequest.RequestFilter`](#type-RequestFilter) `filter` allows limiting the requests for which events are
triggered in various dimensions:

URLs
[URL patterns](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns) such as `*://www.google.com/foo*bar`.
Types
Request types such as `main_frame` (a document that is loaded for a top-level frame), `sub_frame` (a
document that is loaded for an embedded frame), and `image` (an image on a web site). See
[`webRequest.RequestFilter`](#type-RequestFilter).
Tab ID
The identifier for one tab.
Window ID
The identifier for a window.

Depending on the event type, you can specify strings in `opt_extraInfoSpec` to ask for additional
information about the request. This is used to provide detailed information on request's data only
if explicitly requested.

### Handling authentication

To handle requests for HTTP authentication, add the `"webRequestAuthProvider"`
permission to your manifest file:

```
{
  "permissions": [
    "webRequest",
    "webRequestAuthProvider"
  ]
}

```

Note that this permission is not required for a policy installed extension with
the `"webRequestBlocking"` permission.

To provide credentials synchronously:

```
chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener((details) => {
    return {
      authCredentials: {
        username: 'guest',
        password: 'guest'
      }
    };
  },
  { urls: ['https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/guest/guest'] },
  ['blocking']
);

```

To provide credentials asynchronously:

```
chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener((details, callback) => {
    callback({
      authCredentials: {
        username: 'guest',
        password: 'guest'
      }
    });
  },
  { urls: ['https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/guest/guest'] },
  ['asyncBlocking']
);

```
### Implementation details

Several implementation details can be important to understand when developing an extension that uses
the web request API:

#### web\_accessible\_resources

When an extension uses webRequest APIs to redirect a public resource request to a resource that is not web accessible, it is blocked and will result in an error. The above holds true even if the resource that is not web accessible is owned by the redirecting extension. To declare resources for use with declarativeWebRequest APIs, the `"web_accessible_resources"` array must be declared and populated in the manifest as documented [here](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources).

#### Conflict resolution

In the current implementation of the web request API, a request is considered canceled if at
least one extension instructs to cancel the request. If an extension cancels a request, all
extensions are notified by an `onErrorOccurred` event. Only one extension can redirect a
request or modify a header at a time. If more than one extension attempts to modify the request, the
most recently installed extension wins, and all others are ignored. An extension is not notified if
its instruction to modify or redirect has been ignored.

#### Caching

Chrome employs two caches—an on-disk cache and a very fast in-memory cache. The lifetime of an
in-memory cache is attached to the lifetime of a render process, which roughly corresponds to a tab.
Requests that are answered from the in-memory cache are invisible to the web request API. If a
request handler changes its behavior (for example, the behavior according to which requests are
blocked), a simple page refresh might not respect this changed behavior. To ensure the behavior
change goes through, call `handlerBehaviorChanged()` to flush the in-memory cache. But don't do it
often; flushing the cache is a very expensive operation. You don't need to call
`handlerBehaviorChanged()` after registering or unregistering an event listener.

#### Timestamps

The `timestamp` property of web request events is only guaranteed to be *internally* consistent.
Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct offset between them, but comparing
them to the current time inside the extension (via `(new Date()).getTime()`, for instance) might
give unexpected results.

#### Error handling

If you try to register an event with invalid arguments, then a JavaScript error will be thrown, and
the event handler will not be registered. If an error is thrown while an event is handled or if an
event handler returns an invalid blocking response, an error message is logged to your extension's
console, and the handler is ignored for that request.

## Examples

The following example illustrates how to block all requests to `www.evil.com`:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) {
    return {cancel: details.url.indexOf("://www.evil.com/") != -1};
  },
  {urls: ["<all_urls>"]},
  ["blocking"]
);

```

As this function uses a blocking event handler, it requires the `"webRequest"` as well as the
`"webRequestBlocking"` permission in the manifest file.

The following example achieves the same goal in a more efficient way because requests that are not
targeted to `www.evil.com` do not need to be passed to the extension:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) { return {cancel: true}; },
  {urls: ["*://www.evil.com/*"]},
  ["blocking"]
);

```

The following example illustrates how to delete the User-Agent header from all requests:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders.addListener(
  function(details) {
    for (var i = 0; i < details.requestHeaders.length; ++i) {
      if (details.requestHeaders[i].name === 'User-Agent') {
        details.requestHeaders.splice(i, 1);
        break;
      }
    }
    return {requestHeaders: details.requestHeaders};
  },
  {urls: ["<all_urls>"]},
  ["blocking", "requestHeaders"]
);

```

To try the `chrome.webRequest` API,
install the [webRequest sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/webRequest/) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples)
repository.

## Types

### BlockingResponse

Returns value for event handlers that have the 'blocking' extraInfoSpec applied. Allows the event handler to modify network requests.

#### Properties

* authCredentials

  object optional

  Only used as a response to the onAuthRequired event. If set, the request is made using the supplied credentials.

  + password

    string
  + username

    string
* cancel

  boolean optional

  If true, the request is cancelled. This prevents the request from being sent. This can be used as a response to the onBeforeRequest, onBeforeSendHeaders, onHeadersReceived and onAuthRequired events.
* redirectUrl

  string optional

  Only used as a response to the onBeforeRequest and onHeadersReceived events. If set, the original request is prevented from being sent/completed and is instead redirected to the given URL. Redirections to non-HTTP schemes such as `data:` are allowed. Redirects initiated by a redirect action use the original request method for the redirect, with one exception: If the redirect is initiated at the onHeadersReceived stage, then the redirect will be issued using the GET method. Redirects from URLs with `ws://` and `wss://` schemes are **ignored**.
* requestHeaders

  [HttpHeaders](#type-HttpHeaders) optional

  Only used as a response to the onBeforeSendHeaders event. If set, the request is made with these request headers instead.
* responseHeaders

  [HttpHeaders](#type-HttpHeaders) optional

  Only used as a response to the onHeadersReceived event. If set, the server is assumed to have responded with these response headers instead. Only return `responseHeaders` if you really want to modify the headers in order to limit the number of conflicts (only one extension may modify `responseHeaders` for each request).
### FormDataItem

Chrome 66+

Contains data passed within form data. For urlencoded form it is stored as string if data is utf-8 string and as ArrayBuffer otherwise. For form-data it is ArrayBuffer. If form-data represents uploading file, it is string with filename, if the filename is provided.

#### Enum

ArrayBuffer

string

### HttpHeaders

An array of HTTP headers. Each header is represented as a dictionary containing the keys `name` and either `value` or `binaryValue`.

#### Type

object[]

#### Properties

* binaryValue

  number[] optional

  Value of the HTTP header if it cannot be represented by UTF-8, stored as individual byte values (0..255).
* name

  string

  Name of the HTTP header.
* value

  string optional

  Value of the HTTP header if it can be represented by UTF-8.

## Properties

### MAX\_HANDLER\_BEHAVIOR\_CHANGED\_CALLS\_PER\_10\_MINUTES

The maximum number of times that `handlerBehaviorChanged` can be called per 10 minute sustained interval. `handlerBehaviorChanged` is an expensive function call that shouldn't be called often.

#### Value

20   

## Methods

### handlerBehaviorChanged()

Promise

```
chrome.webRequest.handlerBehaviorChanged(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Needs to be called when the behavior of the webRequest handlers has changed to prevent incorrect handling due to caching. This function call is expensive. Don't call it often.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 116+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onActionIgnored

Chrome 70+

```
chrome.webRequest.onActionIgnored.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when an extension's proposed modification to a network request is ignored. This happens in case of conflicts with other extensions.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (details: object) => void
  ```

  + details

    object

    - action

      [IgnoredActionType](#type-IgnoredActionType)

      The proposed action which was ignored.
    - requestId

      string

  callback: function,  
  filter: [RequestFilter](#type-RequestFilter),  
  extraInfoSpec?: [OnAuthRequiredOptions](#type-OnAuthRequiredOptions)[],  
)
```

Fired when an authentication failure is received. The listener has three options: it can provide authentication credentials, it can cancel the request and display the error page, or it can take no action on the challenge. If bad user credentials are provided, this may be called multiple times for the same request. Note, only one of `'blocking'` or `'asyncBlocking'` modes must be specified in the `extraInfoSpec` parameter.

# chrome.windows  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/windows

# chrome.windows

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.windows` API to interact with browser windows. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange windows in the browser.

## Permissions

When requested, a [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) contains an array of [`tabs.Tab`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab) objects. You must
declare the `"tabs"` permission in your [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#manifest) if you need access to the [`url`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-url),
[`pendingUrl`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-pendingUrl), [`title`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-title), or [`favIconUrl`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-favIconUrl) properties of [`tabs.Tab`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": ["tabs"],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### The current window

Many functions in the extension system take an optional `windowId` argument, which defaults to the
current window.

The *current window* is the window that contains the code that is currently executing. It's
important to realize that this can be different from the topmost or focused window.

For example, say an extension creates a few tabs or windows from a single HTML file, and that the
HTML file contains a call to [`tabs.query()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#method-query). The current window is the window that contains the
page that made the call, no matter what the topmost window is.

In the case of [service workers](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers), the value of the current window falls back to the last active
window. Under some circumstances, there may be no current window for background pages.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [windows API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/windows) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

### CreateType

Chrome 44+

Specifies what type of browser window to create. 'panel' is deprecated and is available only to existing allowlisted extensions on Chrome OS.

#### Enum

"normal"   
 Specifies the window as a standard window.

"popup"   
 Specifies the window as a popup window.

"panel"   
 Specifies the window as a panel.

### QueryOptions

Chrome 88+

#### Properties

* populate

  boolean optional

  If true, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) object has a `tabs` property that contains a list of the [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab) objects. The `Tab` objects only contain the `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and `favIconUrl` properties if the extension's manifest file includes the `"tabs"` permission.
* windowTypes

  [WindowType](#type-WindowType)[] optional

  If set, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) returned is filtered based on its type. If unset, the default filter is set to `['normal', 'popup']`.
### Window

#### Properties

  boolean

  Whether the window is set to be always on top.
* focused

  boolean

  Whether the window is currently the focused window.

* incognito

  boolean

  Whether the window is incognito.
* left

  number optional

  The offset of the window from the left edge of the screen in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `left` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

* top

  number optional

  The offset of the window from the top edge of the screen in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `top` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
* type

  [WindowType](#type-WindowType) optional

  The type of browser window this is.
* width

  number optional

  The width of the window, including the frame, in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `width` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
### WindowState

Chrome 44+

The state of this browser window. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `state` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

"minimized"   
 Minimized window state.

"maximized"   
 Maximized window state.

"fullscreen"   
 Fullscreen window state.

"locked-fullscreen"   
 Locked fullscreen window state. This fullscreen state cannot be exited by user action and is available only to allowlisted extensions on Chrome OS.

### WindowType

Chrome 44+

The type of browser window this is. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `type` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onBoundsChanged

Chrome 86+

```
chrome.windows.onBoundsChanged.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when a window has been resized; this event is only dispatched when the new bounds are committed, and not for in-progress changes.

#### Parameters

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (window: [Window](#type-Window)) => void
  ```

  + window

    [Window](#type-Window)
### onCreated

```
chrome.windows.onCreated.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
  filters?: object,  
)

# chrome.browserAction

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use browser actions to put icons in the main Google Chrome toolbar, to the right of the address bar. In addition to its [icon](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/#icon), a browser action can have a [tooltip](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/#tooltip), a [badge](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/#badge), and a [popup](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/#popup).

## Availability

&leq; MV2

In the following figure, the multicolored square to the right of the address bar is the icon for a
browser action. A popup is below the icon.

If you want to create an icon that isn't always active, use a [page action](/docs/extensions/pageAction) instead of a browser
action.

## Manifest

Register your browser action in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) like this:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": {                // optional
      "16": "images/icon16.png",     // optional
      "24": "images/icon24.png",     // optional
      "32": "images/icon32.png"      // optional
    },
    "default_title": "Google Mail",  // optional, shown in tooltip
    "default_popup": "popup.html"    // optional
  },
  ...
}

```

You can provide any size icon to be used in Chrome, and Chrome will select the closest one and scale
it to the appropriate size to fill the 16-dip space. However, if the exact size isn't provided, this
scaling can cause the icon to lose detail or look fuzzy.

Since devices with less-common scale factors like 1.5x or 1.2x are becoming more common, you are
encouraged to provide multiple sizes for your icons. This also ensures that if the icon display size
is ever changed, you don't need to do any more work to provide different icons!

The old syntax for registering the default icon is still supported:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "browser_action": {
    ...
    "default_icon": "images/icon32.png"  // optional
    // equivalent to "default_icon": { "32": "images/icon32.png" }
  },
  ...
}

```
## Parts of the UI

A browser action can have an [icon](#icon), a [tooltip](#tooltip), a [badge](#badge), and a [popup](#popup).

### Icon

The browser action icons in Chrome are 16 dips (device-independent pixels) wide and high. Larger
icons are resized to fit, but for best results, use a 16-dip square icon.

You can set the icon in two ways: using a static image or using the HTML5 [canvas element](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html). Using
static images is easier for simple applications, but you can create more dynamic UIs—such as
smooth animation—using the canvas element.

Static images can be in any format WebKit can display, including BMP, GIF, ICO, JPEG, or PNG. For
unpacked extensions, images must be in the PNG format.

To set the icon, use the **default\_icon** field of **browser\_action** in the [manifest](#manifest), or call
the [`browserAction.setIcon`](#method-setIcon) method.

To properly display icon when screen pixel density (ratio `size_in_pixel / size_in_dip`) is
different than 1, the icon can be defined as set of images with different sizes. The actual image to
display will be selected from the set to best fit the pixel size of 16 dip. The icon set can contain
any size icon specification, and Chrome will select the most appropriate one.

### Tooltip

To set the tooltip, use the **default\_title** field of **browser\_action** in the [manifest](#manifest), or
call the [`browserAction.setTitle`](#method-setTitle) method. You can specify locale-specific strings for the
**default\_title** field; see [Internationalization](/extensions/i18n) for details.

### Badge

Browser actions can optionally display a *badge*—a bit of text that is layered over the icon.
Badges make it easy to update the browser action to display a small amount of information about the
state of the extension.

Because the badge has limited space, it should have 4 characters or less.

Set the text and color of the badge using [`browserAction.setBadgeText`](#method-setBadgeText) and
[`browserAction.setBadgeBackgroundColor`](#method-setBadgeBackgroundColor), respectively.

### Popup

If a browser action has a popup, the popup appears when the user clicks the extension's icon. The
popup can contain any HTML contents that you like, and it's automatically sized to fit its contents.
The popup cannot be smaller than 25x25 and cannot be larger than 800x600.

To add a popup to your browser action, create an HTML file with the popup's contents. Specify the
HTML file in the **default\_popup** field of **browser\_action** in the [manifest](#manifest), or call the
[`browserAction.setPopup`](#method-setPopup) method.

## Tips

For the best visual impact, follow these guidelines:

* **Do** use browser actions for features that make sense on most pages.
* **Don't** use browser actions for features that make sense for only a few pages. Use [page
  actions](/extensions/pageAction) instead.
* **Do** use big, colorful icons that make the most of the 16x16-dip space. Browser action icons
  should seem a little bigger and heavier than page action icons.
* **Don't** attempt to mimic Google Chrome's monochrome menu icon. That doesn't work well with
  themes, and anyway, extensions should stand out a little.
* **Do** use alpha transparency to add soft edges to your icon. Because many people use themes, your
  icon should look nice on a variety of background colors.
* **Don't** constantly animate your icon. That's just annoying.

## Examples

# chrome.contentSettings  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/contentSettings/

# chrome.contentSettings

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.contentSettings` API to change settings that control whether websites can use features such as cookies, JavaScript, and plugins. More generally speaking, content settings allow you to customize Chrome's behavior on a per-site basis instead of globally.

## Permissions

`contentSettings`  

You must declare the `"contentSettings"` permission in your extension's manifest to use the API. For
example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "contentSettings"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Content setting patterns

You can use patterns to specify the websites that each content setting affects. For example,
`https://*.youtube.com/*` specifies youtube.com and all of its subdomains. The syntax for content
setting patterns is the same as for [match patterns](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns), with a few differences:

* For `http`, `https`, and `ftp` URLs, the path must be a wildcard (`/*`). For `file` URLs, the path
  must be completely specified and **must not** contain wildcards.
* In contrast to match patterns, content setting patterns can specify a port number. If a port
  number is specified, the pattern only matches websites with that port. If no port number is
  specified, the pattern matches all ports.

### Pattern precedence

When more than one content setting rule applies for a given site, the rule with the more specific
pattern takes precedence.

For example, the following patterns are ordered by precedence:

1. `https://www.example.com/*`
2. `https://*.example.com/*` (matching example.com and all subdomains)
3. `<all_urls>` (matching every URL)

Three kinds of wildcards affect how specific a pattern is:

* Wildcards in the port (for example `https://www.example.com:*/*`)
* Wildcards in the scheme (for example `*://www.example.com:123/*`)
* Wildcards in the hostname (for example `https://*.example.com:123/*`)

If a pattern is more specific than another pattern in one part but less specific in another part,
the different parts are checked in the following order: hostname, scheme, port. For example, the
following patterns are ordered by precedence:

1. `https://www.example.com:*/*`
   Specifies the hostname and scheme.
2. `*:/www.example.com:123/*`
   Not as high, because although it specifies the hostname, it doesn't specify the scheme.
3. `https://*.example.com:123/*`
   Lower because although it specifies the port and scheme, it has a wildcard in the hostname.

### Primary and secondary patterns

The URL taken into account when deciding which content setting to apply depends on the content type.
For example, for [`contentSettings.notifications`](#property-notifications) settings are based on the URL shown in the
omnibox. This URL is called the "primary" URL.

Some content types can take additional URLs into account. For example, whether a site is allowed to
set a [`contentSettings.cookies`](#property-cookies) is decided based on the URL of the HTTP request (which is the
primary URL in this case) as well as the URL shown in the omnibox (which is called the "secondary"
URL).

If multiple rules have primary and secondary patterns, the rule with the more specific primary
pattern takes precedence. If there multiple rules have the same primary pattern, the rule with the
more specific secondary pattern takes precedence. For example, the following list of
primary/secondary pattern pairs is ordered by precedence:

| Precedence | Primary pattern | Secondary pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `https://www.moose.com/*`, | `https://www.wombat.com/*` |
| 2 | `https://www.moose.com/*`, | `<all_urls>` |
| 3 | `<all_urls>`, | `https://www.wombat.com/*` |
| 4 | `<all_urls>`, | `<all_urls>` |

Secondary patterns are not supported for the images content setting.

### Resource identifiers

Resource identifiers allow you to specify content settings for specific subtypes of a content type.
Currently, the only content type that supports resource identifiers is [`contentSettings.plugins`](#property-plugins),
where a resource identifier identifies a specific plugin. When applying content settings, first the
settings for the specific plugin are checked. If there are no settings found for the specific
plugin, the general content settings for plugins are checked.

For example, if a content setting rule has the resource identifier `adobe-flash-player` and the
pattern `<all_urls>`, it takes precedence over a rule without a resource identifier and the pattern
`https://www.example.com/*`, even if that pattern is more specific.

You can get a list of resource identifiers for a content type by calling the
[`contentSettings.ContentSetting.getResourceIdentifiers()`](#method-ContentSetting-getResourceIdentifiers) method. The returned list can change with
the set of installed plugins on the user's machine, but Chrome tries to keep the identifiers stable
across plugin updates.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [contentSettings API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/contentSettings) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

# chrome.declarativeContent  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeContent/

# chrome.declarativeContent

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.declarativeContent` API to take actions depending on the content of a page, without requiring permission to read the page's content.

## Permissions

`declarativeContent`  
## Concepts and usage

The Declarative Content API lets you enable your extension's action depending on the URL of a
web page, or if a CSS selector matches an element on the page, without needing to
add [host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions) or inject a [content script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts).

Use the [activeTab](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission to interact with a page after the user clicks on the
extension's action.

### Rules

Rules consists of conditions and actions. If any of the conditions is fulfilled, all actions are
executed. The actions are [`setIcon()`](#type-SetIcon) and [`showAction()`](#type-ShowAction).

The [`PageStateMatcher`](#type-PageStateMatcher) matches web pages if and only if all listed
criteria are met. It can match a [page url](#page-url), a [css compound selector](#css)
or the [bookmarked state](#bookmarked) of a page. The following rule enables
the extension's action on Google pages when a password field is present:

```
let rule1 = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      pageUrl: { hostSuffix: '.google.com', schemes: ['https'] },
      css: ["input[type='password']"]
    })
  ],
  actions: [ new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction() ]
};

```

To also enable the extension's action for Google sites with a video, you can add a second
condition, as each condition is sufficient to trigger all specified actions:

```
let rule2 = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      pageUrl: { hostSuffix: '.google.com', schemes: ['https'] },
      css: ["input[type='password']"]
    }),
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      css: ["video"]
    })
  ],
  actions: [ new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction() ]
};

```

The [`onPageChanged`](#event-onPageChanged) event tests whether any rule has at least one fulfilled
condition and executes the actions. Rules persist across browsing sessions; therefore, during
extension installation time you should first use [`removeRules`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#remove_rules) to clear
previously installed rules and then use [`addRules`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#add_rules) to register new ones.

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function(details) {
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, function() {
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([rule2]);
  });
});

```

With the [activeTab](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, your extension won't display any permission
warnings and when the user clicks the extension action, it will only run on relevant pages.

### Page URL matching

The [`PageStateMatcher.pageurl`](#property-PageStateMatcher-pageUrl) matches when the URL criteria are fulfilled. The
most common criteria are a concatenation of either host, path, or URL, followed by Contains, Equals, Prefix, or
Suffix. The following table contains a few examples:

| Criteria | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `{ hostSuffix: 'google.com' }` | All Google URLs |
| `{ pathPrefix: '/docs/extensions'` } | Extension docs URLs |
| `{ urlContains: 'developer.chrome.com'` } | All chrome developers docs URLs |

All criteria are case sensitive. For a complete list of criteria, see [UrlFilter](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#type-UrlFilter).

### CSS Matching

[`PageStateMatcher.css`](#property-PageStateMatcher-css) conditions must be *[compound selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#compound)*,
meaning that you can't include [combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors#combinators) like whitespace or "`>`" in your
selectors. This helps Chrome match the selectors more efficiently.

| Compound Selectors (OK) | Complex Selectors (Not OK) |
| --- | --- |
| `a` | `div p` |
| `iframe.special[src^='http']` | `p>span.highlight` |
| `ns|*` | `p + ol` |
| `#abcd:checked` | `p::first-line` |

CSS conditions only match displayed elements: if an element that matches your selector is
`display:none` or one of its parent elements is `display:none`, it doesn't cause the condition to
match. Elements styled with `visibility:hidden`, positioned off-screen, or hidden by other elements
can still make your condition match.

### Bookmarked state matching

The [`PageStateMatcher.isBookmarked`](#property-PageStateMatcher-isBookmarked) condition allows matching of the
bookmarked state of the current URL in the user's profile. To make use of this condition the
"bookmarks" permission must be declared in the extension [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

## Types

### ImageDataType

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData>.

#### Type

ImageData

### PageStateMatcher

Matches the state of a web page based on various criteria.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)
  + returns

    [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)
* css

  string[] optional

  Matches if all of the CSS selectors in the array match displayed elements in a frame with the same origin as the page's main frame. All selectors in this array must be [compound selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#compound) to speed up matching. Note: Listing hundreds of CSS selectors or listing CSS selectors that match hundreds of times per page can slow down web sites.
* isBookmarked

  boolean optional

  Chrome 45+

  Matches if the bookmarked state of the page is equal to the specified value. Requres the [bookmarks permission](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions).
* pageUrl

  [UrlFilter](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/events/#type-UrlFilter) optional

  Matches if the conditions of the `UrlFilter` are fulfilled for the top-level URL of the page.
### RequestContentScript

Declarative event action that injects a content script.

**WARNING:** This action is still experimental and is not supported on stable builds of Chrome.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)
  + returns

    [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)
* allFrames

  boolean optional

  Whether the content script runs in all frames of the matching page, or in only the top frame. Default is `false`.
* css

  string[] optional

  Names of CSS files to be injected as a part of the content script.
* js

  string[] optional

  Names of JavaScript files to be injected as a part of the content script.
* matchAboutBlank

  boolean optional

  Whether to insert the content script on `about:blank` and `about:srcdoc`. Default is `false`.
### SetIcon

Declarative event action that sets the n-dip square icon for the extension's [page action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/pageAction/) or [browser action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/) while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions), but the extension must have a page or browser action.

Exactly one of `imageData` or `path` must be specified. Both are dictionaries mapping a number of pixels to an image representation. The image representation in `imageData` is an [ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData) object; for example, from a `canvas` element, while the image representation in `path` is the path to an image file relative to the extension's manifest. If `scale` screen pixels fit into a device-independent pixel, the `scale * n` icon is used. If that scale is missing, another image is resized to the required size.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)
  + returns

    [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)
* imageData

  ImageData | object optional

  Either an `ImageData` object or a dictionary {size -> ImageData} representing an icon to be set. If the icon is specified as a dictionary, the image used is chosen depending on the screen's pixel density. If the number of image pixels that fit into one screen space unit equals `scale`, then an image with size `scale * n` is selected, where *n* is the size of the icon in the UI. At least one image must be specified. Note that `details.imageData = foo` is equivalent to `details.imageData = {'16': foo}`.
### ShowAction

Chrome 97+

A declarative event action that sets the extension's toolbar [action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/) to an enabled state while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions). If the extension has the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, clicking the page action grants access to the active tab.

On pages where the conditions are not met the extension's toolbar action will be grey-scale, and clicking it will open the context menu, instead of triggering the action.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)
  + returns

    [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)
### ShowPageAction

Deprecated since Chrome 97

Please use [`declarativeContent.ShowAction`](#type-ShowAction).

A declarative event action that sets the extension's [page action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/pageAction/) to an enabled state while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions), but the extension must have a page action. If the extension has the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, clicking the page action grants access to the active tab.

On pages where the conditions are not met the extension's toolbar action will be grey-scale, and clicking it will open the context menu, instead of triggering the action.

#### Properties

* constructor

  void

  The `constructor` function looks like:
  ```
  (arg: [ShowPageAction](#type-ShowPageAction)) => {...}
  ```

  + arg

    [ShowPageAction](#type-ShowPageAction)
  + returns

    [ShowPageAction](#type-ShowPageAction)
## Events

# chrome.declarativeNetRequest  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest

# chrome.declarativeNetRequest

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` API is used to block or modify network requests by specifying declarative rules. This lets extensions modify network requests without intercepting them and viewing their content, thus providing more privacy.

## Permissions

`declarativeNetRequest`  
`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`  

The "`declarativeNetRequest`" and "`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`" permissions
provide the same capabilities. The differences between them is when permissions are
requested or granted.

`"declarativeNetRequest"`
Triggers a permission warning at install time but provides implicit access to
`allow`, `allowAllRequests` and `block` rules. Use this when possible to avoid
needing to request full access to hosts.
`"declarativeNetRequestFeedback"`
Enables debugging features for [unpacked extensions](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked), specifically [`getMatchedRules()`](#method-getMatchedRules) and [`onRuleMatchedDebug`](#event-onRuleMatchedDebug).
`"declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess"`
A permission warning is not shown at install time, but you must request host
permissions before you can perform any action on a host. This
is appropriate when you want to use declarative net request rules in an
extension which already has host permissions without generating additional
warnings.
## Availability

Chrome 84+

## Manifest

In addition to the permissions described previously, certain types of rulesets, static rulesets specifically, require declaring the `"declarative_net_request"` manifest key, which should be a dictionary with a single key called `"rule_resources"`. This key is an array containing dictionaries of type `Ruleset`, as shown in the following. (Note that the name 'Ruleset' does not appear in the manifest's JSON since it is merely an array.) [Static rulesets](#rules) are explained later in this document.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...

  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : [{
      "id": "ruleset_1",
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "rules_1.json"
    }, {
      "id": "ruleset_2",
      "enabled": false,
      "path": "rules_2.json"
    }]
  },
  "permissions": [
    "declarativeNetRequest",
    "declarativeNetRequestFeedback",
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://www.blogger.com/*",
    "http://*.google.com/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Rules and rulesets

To use this API, specify one or more rulesets. A ruleset contains an array of rules. A single rule does one of the following:

* Block a network request.
* Upgrade the schema (http to https).
* Prevent a request from getting blocked by negating any matching blocked rules.
* Redirect a network request.
* Modify request or response headers.

There are three types of rulesets, managed in slightly different ways.

Dynamic
Persist across browser sessions and extension upgrades and are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.
Session
Cleared when the browser shuts down and when a new version of the extension is installed. Session rules are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.
Static
Packaged, installed, and updated when an extension is installed or upgraded. Static rules are stored in JSON-formatted rule files and listed in the manifest file.
### Dynamic and session-scoped rulesets

Dynamic and session rulesets are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.

* Dynamic rules persist across browser sessions and extension upgrades.
* Session rules are cleared when the browser shuts down and when a new version of the extension is installed.

There is only one each of these ruleset types. An extension can add or remove rules to them dynamically by calling [`updateDynamicRules()`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#method-updateDynamicRules) and [`updateSessionRules()`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#method-updateSessionRules), provided the rule limits aren't exceeded. For information on rule limits, see [Rule limits](#limits). You can see [an example of this](#update-dynamic-rule-examples) under [code examples](#code-examples).

### Static rulesets

Unlike dynamic and session rules, static rules are packaged, installed, and updated when an extension is installed or upgraded. They're stored in rule files in JSON format, which are indicated to the extension using the `"declarative_net_request"` and `"rule_resources"` keys [as described above](#manifest), as well as one or more [`Ruleset`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#type-Ruleset) dictionaries. A `Ruleset` dictionary contains a path to the rule file, an ID for the ruleset contained in the file, and whether the ruleset is enabled or disabled. The last two are important when you enable or disable a ruleset programmatically.

```
{
  ...
  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : [{
      "id": "ruleset_1",
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "rules_1.json"
    },
    ...
    ]
  }
  ...
}

```

To test rule files, [load your extension unpacked](/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics#load-unpacked). Errors and warnings about invalid static rules are only displayed for unpacked extensions. Invalid static rules in packed extensions are ignored.

## Expedited review

Changes to static rulesets may be eligible for expedited review. See
[expedited review for eligible changes](/docs/webstore/expedited-review).

## Enable and disable static rules and rulesets

Both individual static rules and complete static rulesets may be enabled or disabled at runtime.

The set of enabled static rules and rulesets is persisted across browser sessions. Neither are persisted across extension updates, meaning that only rules you chose to leave in your rule files are available after an update.

For performance reasons there are also limits to the number of rules and rulesets that may be enabled at one time. Call [`getAvailableStaticRuleCount()`](#method-getAvailableStaticRuleCount) to check the number of additional rules that may be enabled. For information on rule limits, see [Rule limits](#limits).

To enable or disable static *rules*, call [`updateStaticRules()`](#method-updateStaticRules). This method takes an [`UpdateStaticRulesOptions`](#type-UpdateStaticRulesOptions) object, which contains arrays of IDs of rules to enable or disable. The IDs are defined using the `"id"` key of the `Ruleset` dictionary. There is a maximum limit of 5000 disabled static rules.

To enable or disable static *rulesets*, call [`updateEnabledRulesets()`](#method-updateEnabledRulesets). This method takes an [`UpdateRulesetOptions`](#type-UpdateRulesetOptions) object, which contains arrays of IDs of rulesets to enable or disable. The IDs are defined using the `"id"` key of the `Ruleset` dictionary.

## Build rules

Regardless of type, a rule starts with four fields as shown in the following. While the `"id"` and `"priority"` keys take a number, the [`"action"`](#property-Rule-action) and [`"condition"`](#property-Rule-condition) keys may provide several blocking and redirecting conditions. The following rule blocks all script requests originating from `"foo.com"` to any URL with `"abc"` as a substring.

```
{
  "id" : 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action" : { "type" : "block" },
  "condition" : {
    "urlFilter" : "abc",
    "initiatorDomains" : ["foo.com"],
    "resourceTypes" : ["script"]
  }
}

```
## URL matching

Declarative Net Request provides the ability to match URLs with either a pattern
matching syntax or regular expressions.

### URL filter syntax

A rule's `"condition"` key allows a `"urlFilter"` key for acting on URLs under a specified domain. You create patterns using [pattern matching tokens](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#property-RuleCondition-urlFilter). Here are a few examples.

| `urlFilter` | Matches | Does not match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"abc"` | https://abcd.comhttps://example.com/abcd | https://ab.com |
| `"abc*d"` | https://abcd.comhttps://example.com/abcxyzd | https://abc.com |
| `"||a.example.com"` | https://a.example.com/https://b.a.example.com/xyzhttps://a.example.company | https://example.com/ |
| `"|https*"` | https://example.com | http://example.com/http://https.com |
| `"example*^123|"` | https://example.com/123http://abc.com/example?123 | https://example.com/1234https://abc.com/example0123 |

### Regular expressions

Conditions can also use regular expressions. See the
[`"regexFilter"`](#property-RuleCondition-regexFilter) key. To learn about the
limits that apply to these conditions, see
[Rules that use regular expressions](#regex-rules).

### Write good URL conditions

Take care when writing rules to always match an entire domain. Otherwise, your
rule may match in situations that are unexpected. For example, when using the
pattern matching syntax:

* `google.com` incorrectly matches `https://example.com/?param=google.com`
* `||google.com` incorrectly matches `https://google.company`
* `https://www.google.com` incorrectly matches `https://example.com/?param=https://www.google.com`

Consider using:

* `||google.com/`, which matches all paths and all subdomains.
* `|https://www.google.com/` which matches all paths and no subdomains.

Similarly, use the `^` and `/` characters to anchor a regular expression. For
example, `^https:\/\/www\.google\.com\/` matches any path on
https://www.google.com.

## Rule evaluation

DNR rules are applied by the browser across various stages of the network request lifecycle.

### Before the request

Before a request is made, an extension can block or redirect (including upgrading the scheme from HTTP to HTTPS) it with a matching rule.

For each extension, the browser determines a list of matching rules. Rules with a `modifyHeaders` action are not included here as they will be handled later. Additionally, rules with a `responseHeaders` condition will be considered later (when response headers are available) and are not included.

Then, for each extension, Chrome picks at most one candidate per request. Chrome finds a matching rule, by ordering all matching rules by priority. Rules with the same priority are ordered by action (`allow` or `allowAllRequests` > `block` > `upgradeScheme` > `redirect`).

If the candidate is an `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rule, or the frame the request is being made in previously matched an `allowAllRequests` rule of higher or equal priority from this extension, the request is "allowed" and the extension won't have any effect on the request.

If more than one extension wants to block or redirect this request, a single action to take is chosen. Chrome does this by sorting the rules in the order `block` > `redirect` or `upgradeScheme` > `allow` or `allowAllRequests`. If two rules are of the same type, Chrome chooses the rule from the most recently installed extension.

### Before request headers are sent

Before Chrome sends request headers to the server, the headers are updated based on matching `modifyHeaders` rules.

Within a single extension, Chrome builds the list of modifications to perform by finding all matching `modifyHeaders` rules. Similar to before, only rules which have a higher priority than any matching `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rules are included.

These rules are applied by Chrome in an order such that rules from a more recently installed extension are always evaluated before rules from an older extension. Additionally, rules of a higher priority from one extension are always applied before rules of a lower priority from the same extension. Notably, even across extensions:

* If a rule appends to a header, then lower priority rules can only append to that header. Set and remove operations are not allowed.
* If a rule sets a header, then only lower priority rules from the same extension can append to that header. No other modifications are allowed.
* If a rule removes a header, then lower priority rules cannot further modify the header.

### Once a response is received

Once the response headers have been received, Chrome evaluates rules with a `responseHeaders` condition.

After sorting these rules by `action` and `priority` and excluding any rules made redundant by a matching `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rule (this happens identically to the steps in "Before the request"), Chrome may block or redirect the request on behalf of an extension.

Note that if a request made it to this stage, the request has already been sent to the server and the server has received data like the request body. A block or redirect rule with a response headers condition will still run–but cannot actually block or redirect the request.

In the case of a block rule, this is handled by the page which made the request receiving a blocked response and Chrome terminating the request early. In the case of a redirect rule, Chrome makes a new request to the redirected URL. Make sure to consider if these behaviors meet the privacy expectations for your extension.

If the request is not blocked or redirected, Chrome applies any `modifyHeaders` rules. Applying modifications to response headers works in the same way as described in "Before request headers are sent". Applying modifications to request headers does nothing, since the request has already been made.

## Safe rules

Safe rules are defined as rules with an action of `block`, `allow`,
`allowAllRequests` or `upgradeScheme`. These rules are subject to an increased
dynamic rules [quota](#dynamic-rules).

## Rule limits

There is a performance overhead to loading and evaluating rules in the browser,
so some limits apply when using the API. Limits depend on the type of
rule you're using.

### Static rules

Static rules are those specified in rule files declared in the manifest file. An extension can specify up to 100 static [rulesets](#type-Ruleset) as part of the `"rule_resources"` manifest key, but only 50 of these rulesets can be enabled at a time. The latter is called the [`MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS). Collectively, those rulesets are guaranteed at least 30,000 rules. This is called the [`GUARANTEED_MINIMUM_STATIC_RULES`](#property-GUARANTEED_MINIMUM_STATIC_RULES).

The number of rules available after that depends on how many rules are enabled by all the extensions installed on a user's browser. You can find this number at runtime by calling [`getAvailableStaticRuleCount()`](#method-getAvailableStaticRuleCount). You can see [an example of this](#update-static-rulesets) under [code examples](#code-examples).

### Session rules

An extension can have up to 5000 session rules. This is exposed as the
[`MAX_NUMBER_OF_SESSION_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_SESSION_RULES).

Before Chrome 120, there was a limit of 5000 combined dynamic and session rules.

### Dynamic rules

An extension can have at least 5000 dynamic rules. This is exposed as the
[`MAX_NUMBER_OF_UNSAFE_DYNAMIC_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_UNSAFE_DYNAMIC_RULES).

Starting in Chrome 121, there is a larger limit of 30,000 rules available for [safe](#safe_rules) dynamic rules,
exposed as the [`MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES). Any
unsafe rules added within the limit of 5000 will also count towards this limit.

Before Chrome 120, there was a 5000 combined dynamic and session rules limit.

### Rules that use regular expressions

All types of rules can use regular expressions; however, the total number of regular expression rules of each type cannot exceed 1000. This is called the [MAX\_NUMBER\_OF\_REGEX\_RULES](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_REGEX_RULES).

Additionally, each rule must be less than 2KB once compiled. This roughly correlates with the complexity of the rule. If you try to load a rule that exceeds this limit, you will see a warning like the following and the rule will be ignored.

```
rules_1.json: Rule with id 1 specified a more complex regex than allowed
as part of the "regexFilter" key.

```
## Interactions with service workers

A declarativeNetRequest only applies to requests that reach the network stack. This includes responses from the HTTP cache, but may not include responses that go through a service worker's `onfetch` handler. declarativeNetRequest won't affect responses generated by the service worker or retrieved from `CacheStorage`, but it will affect calls to `fetch()` made in a service worker.

## Web accessible resources

A declarativeNetRequest rule cannot redirect from a public resource request to a resource that is not web accessible. Doing so triggers an error. This is true even if the specified web accessible resource is owned by the redirecting extension. To declare resources for declarativeNetRequest, use the manifest's [`"web_accessible_resources"`](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) array.

## Header modification

The append operation is only supported for the following headers: `accept`, `accept-encoding`, `accept-language`, `access-control-request-headers`, `cache-control`, `connection`, `content-language`, `cookie`, `forwarded`, `if-match`, `if-none-match`, `keep-alive`, `range`, `te`, `trailer`, `transfer-encoding`, `upgrade`, `user-agent`, `via`, `want-digest`, `x-forwarded-for`.

## Examples

### Code examples

#### Update dynamic rules

The following example shows how to call `updateDynamicRules()`. The procedure for `updateSessionRules()` is the same.

```
// Get arrays containing new and old rules
const newRules = await getNewRules();
const oldRules = await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getDynamicRules();
const oldRuleIds = oldRules.map(rule => rule.id);

// Use the arrays to update the dynamic rules
await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules({
  removeRuleIds: oldRuleIds,
  addRules: newRules
});

```
#### Update static rulesets

The following example shows how to enable and disable rulesets while considering the number of available and the maximum number of enabled static rulesets. You would do this when the number of static rules you need exceeds the number allowed. For this to work, some of your rulesets should be installed with some of your rulesets disabled (setting `"Enabled"` to `false` within the manifest file).

```
async function updateStaticRules(enableRulesetIds, disableCandidateIds) {
  // Create the options structure for the call to updateEnabledRulesets()
  let options = { enableRulesetIds: enableRulesetIds }
  // Get the number of enabled static rules
  const enabledStaticCount = await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getEnabledRulesets();
  // Compare rule counts to determine if anything needs to be disabled so that
  // new rules can be enabled
  const proposedCount = enableRulesetIds.length;
  if (enabledStaticCount + proposedCount > chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS) {
    options.disableRulesetIds = disableCandidateIds
  }
  // Update the enabled static rules
  await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateEnabledRulesets(options);
}

```
### Rule examples

The following examples illustrate how Chrome prioritizes rules in an extension. When reviewing them, you may want to open the [prioritization](#implementation-matching-algorithm) rules in a separate window.

#### The "priority" key

These examples require [host permission](/docs/extensions/mv3/declare_permissions) to `*://*.example.com/*`.

To work out the priority of a particular URL, look at the (developer-defined) `"priority"` key, the `"action"` key and the `"urlFilter"` key. These examples refer to the example rule file shown below them.

Navigation to https://google.com
Two rules cover this URL: the rules with IDs 1 and 4. The rule with ID 1 applies because `"block"` actions have a higher priority than `"redirect"` actions. The remaining rules don't apply because they are for longer URLs.
Navigation to https://google.com/1234
Because of the longer URL, the rule with ID 2 now matches in addition to the rules with IDs 1 and 4. The rule with ID 2 applies because `"allow"` has a higher priority than `"block"` and `"redirect"`.
Navigation to https://google.com/12345
All four rules match this URL. The rule with ID 3 applies because its developer-defined priority is the highest of the group.

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "block" },
    "condition": {"urlFilter": "||google.com/", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "allow" },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/123", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "priority": 2,
    "action": { "type": "block" },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/12345", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "redirect", "redirect": { "url": "https://example.com" } },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
]

```
#### Redirects

The example below requires [host permission](/docs/extensions/mv3/declare_permissions) to `*://*.example.com/*`.

The following example shows how to redirect a request from example.com to a page within the extension itself. The extension path `/a.jpg` resolves to `chrome-extension://EXTENSION_ID/a.jpg`, where `EXTENSION_ID` is the ID of your extension. For this to work the manifest should declare `/a.jpg` as a [web accessible resource](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources).

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": { "type": "redirect", "redirect": { "extensionPath": "/a.jpg" } },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||https://www.example.com/",
    "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"]
  }
}

```

The following uses the `"transform"` key to redirect to a subdomain of example.com. It uses a domain name anchor ("||") to intercept requests with any scheme from example.com. The `"scheme"` key in `"transform"` specifies that redirects to the subdomain will always use "https".

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "redirect",
    "redirect": {
      "transform": { "scheme": "https", "host": "new.example.com" }
    }
  },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||example.com/",
    "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"]
  }
}

```

The following example uses regular expressions to redirect from `https://www.abc.xyz.com/path` to `https://abc.xyz.com/path`. In the `"regexFilter"` key, notice how periods are escaped and that the capturing group selects either "abc" or "def". The `"regexSubstitution"` key specifies the first returned match of the regular expression using "\1". In this case, "abc" is captured from the redirected URL and placed in the substitution.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "redirect",
    "redirect": {
      "regexSubstitution": "https://\\1.xyz.com/"
    }
  },
  "condition": {
    "regexFilter": "^https://www\\.(abc|def)\\.xyz\\.com/",
    "resourceTypes": [
      "main_frame"
    ]
  }
}

```
#### Headers

The following example removes all cookies from both a main frame and any sub frames.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "modifyHeaders",
    "requestHeaders": [{ "header": "cookie", "operation": "remove" }]
  },
  "condition": { "resourceTypes": ["main_frame", "sub_frame"] }
}

```
## Types

  [DomainType](#type-DomainType) optional

  Specifies whether the network request is first-party or third-party to the domain from which it originated. If omitted, all requests are accepted.
* domains

  string[] optional

  Deprecated since Chrome 101

  Use [`initiatorDomains`](#property-RuleCondition-initiatorDomains) instead

  The rule will only match network requests originating from the list of `domains`.
* excludedDomains

  string[] optional

  Deprecated since Chrome 101

  Use [`excludedInitiatorDomains`](#property-RuleCondition-excludedInitiatorDomains) instead

  The rule will not match network requests originating from the list of `excludedDomains`.
* excludedInitiatorDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will not match network requests originating from the list of `excludedInitiatorDomains`. If the list is empty or omitted, no domains are excluded. This takes precedence over `initiatorDomains`.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + This matches against the request initiator and not the request url.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also excluded.
* excludedRequestDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will not match network requests when the domains matches one from the list of `excludedRequestDomains`. If the list is empty or omitted, no domains are excluded. This takes precedence over `requestDomains`.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also excluded.
* excludedRequestMethods

  [RequestMethod](#type-RequestMethod)[] optional

  Chrome 91+

  List of request methods which the rule won't match. Only one of `requestMethods` and `excludedRequestMethods` should be specified. If neither of them is specified, all request methods are matched.
* excludedResourceTypes

  [ResourceType](#type-ResourceType)[] optional

  List of resource types which the rule won't match. Only one of `resourceTypes` and `excludedResourceTypes` should be specified. If neither of them is specified, all resource types except "main\_frame" are blocked.
* excludedResponseHeaders

  [HeaderInfo](#type-HeaderInfo)[] optional

  Chrome 128+

  Rule does not match if the request matches any response header condition in this list (if specified). If both `excludedResponseHeaders` and `responseHeaders` are specified, then the `excludedResponseHeaders` property takes precedence.
* excludedTabIds

  number[] optional

  Chrome 92+

  List of [`tabs.Tab.id`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-Tab-id) which the rule should not match. An ID of [`tabs.TAB_ID_NONE`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-TAB_ID_NONE) excludes requests which don't originate from a tab. Only supported for session-scoped rules.
* initiatorDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will only match network requests originating from the list of `initiatorDomains`. If the list is omitted, the rule is applied to requests from all domains. An empty list is not allowed.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + This matches against the request initiator and not the request url.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also matched.
* isUrlFilterCaseSensitive

  boolean optional

  Whether the `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` (whichever is specified) is case sensitive. Default is false.
* regexFilter

  string optional

  Regular expression to match against the network request url. This follows the [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

  Note: Only one of `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` can be specified.

  Note: The `regexFilter` must be composed of only ASCII characters. This is matched against a url where the host is encoded in the punycode format (in case of internationalized domains) and any other non-ascii characters are url encoded in utf-8.
* requestDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will only match network requests when the domain matches one from the list of `requestDomains`. If the list is omitted, the rule is applied to requests from all domains. An empty list is not allowed.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also matched.
* requestMethods

  [RequestMethod](#type-RequestMethod)[] optional

  Chrome 91+

  List of HTTP request methods which the rule can match. An empty list is not allowed.

  Note: Specifying a `requestMethods` rule condition will also exclude non-HTTP(s) requests, whereas specifying `excludedRequestMethods` will not.
* resourceTypes

  [ResourceType](#type-ResourceType)[] optional

  List of resource types which the rule can match. An empty list is not allowed.

  Note: this must be specified for `allowAllRequests` rules and may only include the `sub_frame` and `main_frame` resource types.
* responseHeaders

  [HeaderInfo](#type-HeaderInfo)[] optional

  Chrome 128+

  Rule matches if the request matches any response header condition in this list (if specified).
* tabIds

  number[] optional

  Chrome 92+

  List of [`tabs.Tab.id`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-Tab-id) which the rule should match. An ID of [`tabs.TAB_ID_NONE`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-TAB_ID_NONE) matches requests which don't originate from a tab. An empty list is not allowed. Only supported for session-scoped rules.
* urlFilter

  string optional

  The pattern which is matched against the network request url. Supported constructs:

  **'\*'** : Wildcard: Matches any number of characters.

  **'|'** : Left/right anchor: If used at either end of the pattern, specifies the beginning/end of the url respectively.

  **'||'** : Domain name anchor: If used at the beginning of the pattern, specifies the start of a (sub-)domain of the URL.

  **'^'** : Separator character: This matches anything except a letter, a digit, or one of the following: `_`, `-`, `.`, or `%`. This also match the end of the URL.

  Therefore `urlFilter` is composed of the following parts: (optional Left/Domain name anchor) + pattern + (optional Right anchor).

  If omitted, all urls are matched. An empty string is not allowed.

  A pattern beginning with `||*` is not allowed. Use `*` instead.

  Note: Only one of `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` can be specified.

  Note: The `urlFilter` must be composed of only ASCII characters. This is matched against a url where the host is encoded in the punycode format (in case of internationalized domains) and any other non-ascii characters are url encoded in utf-8. For example, when the request url is http://abc.рф?q=ф, the `urlFilter` will be matched against the url http://abc.xn--p1ai/?q=%D1%84.

## Description

The `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` API is used to block or modify network requests by specifying declarative rules. This lets extensions modify network requests without intercepting them and viewing their content, thus providing more privacy.

## Permissions

`declarativeNetRequest`  
`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`  

The "`declarativeNetRequest`" and "`declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`" permissions
provide the same capabilities. The differences between them is when permissions are
requested or granted.

`"declarativeNetRequest"`
Triggers a permission warning at install time but provides implicit access to
`allow`, `allowAllRequests` and `block` rules. Use this when possible to avoid
needing to request full access to hosts.
`"declarativeNetRequestFeedback"`
Enables debugging features for [unpacked extensions](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked), specifically [`getMatchedRules()`](#method-getMatchedRules) and [`onRuleMatchedDebug`](#event-onRuleMatchedDebug).
`"declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess"`
A permission warning is not shown at install time, but you must request host
permissions before you can perform any action on a host. This
is appropriate when you want to use declarative net request rules in an
extension which already has host permissions without generating additional
warnings.
## Availability

Chrome 84+

## Manifest

In addition to the permissions described previously, certain types of rulesets, static rulesets specifically, require declaring the `"declarative_net_request"` manifest key, which should be a dictionary with a single key called `"rule_resources"`. This key is an array containing dictionaries of type `Ruleset`, as shown in the following. (Note that the name 'Ruleset' does not appear in the manifest's JSON since it is merely an array.) [Static rulesets](#rules) are explained later in this document.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...

  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : [{
      "id": "ruleset_1",
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "rules_1.json"
    }, {
      "id": "ruleset_2",
      "enabled": false,
      "path": "rules_2.json"
    }]
  },
  "permissions": [
    "declarativeNetRequest",
    "declarativeNetRequestFeedback",
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://www.blogger.com/*",
    "http://*.google.com/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Rules and rulesets

To use this API, specify one or more rulesets. A ruleset contains an array of rules. A single rule does one of the following:

* Block a network request.
* Upgrade the schema (http to https).
* Prevent a request from getting blocked by negating any matching blocked rules.
* Redirect a network request.
* Modify request or response headers.

There are three types of rulesets, managed in slightly different ways.

Dynamic
Persist across browser sessions and extension upgrades and are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.
Session
Cleared when the browser shuts down and when a new version of the extension is installed. Session rules are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.
Static
Packaged, installed, and updated when an extension is installed or upgraded. Static rules are stored in JSON-formatted rule files and listed in the manifest file.
### Dynamic and session-scoped rulesets

Dynamic and session rulesets are managed using JavaScript while an extension is in use.

* Dynamic rules persist across browser sessions and extension upgrades.
* Session rules are cleared when the browser shuts down and when a new version of the extension is installed.

There is only one each of these ruleset types. An extension can add or remove rules to them dynamically by calling [`updateDynamicRules()`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#method-updateDynamicRules) and [`updateSessionRules()`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#method-updateSessionRules), provided the rule limits aren't exceeded. For information on rule limits, see [Rule limits](#limits). You can see [an example of this](#update-dynamic-rule-examples) under [code examples](#code-examples).

### Static rulesets

Unlike dynamic and session rules, static rules are packaged, installed, and updated when an extension is installed or upgraded. They're stored in rule files in JSON format, which are indicated to the extension using the `"declarative_net_request"` and `"rule_resources"` keys [as described above](#manifest), as well as one or more [`Ruleset`](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#type-Ruleset) dictionaries. A `Ruleset` dictionary contains a path to the rule file, an ID for the ruleset contained in the file, and whether the ruleset is enabled or disabled. The last two are important when you enable or disable a ruleset programmatically.

```
{
  ...
  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : [{
      "id": "ruleset_1",
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "rules_1.json"
    },
    ...
    ]
  }
  ...
}

```

To test rule files, [load your extension unpacked](/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics#load-unpacked). Errors and warnings about invalid static rules are only displayed for unpacked extensions. Invalid static rules in packed extensions are ignored.

## Expedited review

Changes to static rulesets may be eligible for expedited review. See
[expedited review for eligible changes](/docs/webstore/expedited-review).

## Enable and disable static rules and rulesets

Both individual static rules and complete static rulesets may be enabled or disabled at runtime.

The set of enabled static rules and rulesets is persisted across browser sessions. Neither are persisted across extension updates, meaning that only rules you chose to leave in your rule files are available after an update.

For performance reasons there are also limits to the number of rules and rulesets that may be enabled at one time. Call [`getAvailableStaticRuleCount()`](#method-getAvailableStaticRuleCount) to check the number of additional rules that may be enabled. For information on rule limits, see [Rule limits](#limits).

To enable or disable static *rules*, call [`updateStaticRules()`](#method-updateStaticRules). This method takes an [`UpdateStaticRulesOptions`](#type-UpdateStaticRulesOptions) object, which contains arrays of IDs of rules to enable or disable. The IDs are defined using the `"id"` key of the `Ruleset` dictionary. There is a maximum limit of 5000 disabled static rules.

To enable or disable static *rulesets*, call [`updateEnabledRulesets()`](#method-updateEnabledRulesets). This method takes an [`UpdateRulesetOptions`](#type-UpdateRulesetOptions) object, which contains arrays of IDs of rulesets to enable or disable. The IDs are defined using the `"id"` key of the `Ruleset` dictionary.

## Build rules

Regardless of type, a rule starts with four fields as shown in the following. While the `"id"` and `"priority"` keys take a number, the [`"action"`](#property-Rule-action) and [`"condition"`](#property-Rule-condition) keys may provide several blocking and redirecting conditions. The following rule blocks all script requests originating from `"foo.com"` to any URL with `"abc"` as a substring.

```
{
  "id" : 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action" : { "type" : "block" },
  "condition" : {
    "urlFilter" : "abc",
    "initiatorDomains" : ["foo.com"],
    "resourceTypes" : ["script"]
  }
}

```
## URL matching

Declarative Net Request provides the ability to match URLs with either a pattern
matching syntax or regular expressions.

### URL filter syntax

A rule's `"condition"` key allows a `"urlFilter"` key for acting on URLs under a specified domain. You create patterns using [pattern matching tokens](/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest#property-RuleCondition-urlFilter). Here are a few examples.

| `urlFilter` | Matches | Does not match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"abc"` | https://abcd.comhttps://example.com/abcd | https://ab.com |
| `"abc*d"` | https://abcd.comhttps://example.com/abcxyzd | https://abc.com |
| `"||a.example.com"` | https://a.example.com/https://b.a.example.com/xyzhttps://a.example.company | https://example.com/ |
| `"|https*"` | https://example.com | http://example.com/http://https.com |
| `"example*^123|"` | https://example.com/123http://abc.com/example?123 | https://example.com/1234https://abc.com/example0123 |

### Regular expressions

Conditions can also use regular expressions. See the
[`"regexFilter"`](#property-RuleCondition-regexFilter) key. To learn about the
limits that apply to these conditions, see
[Rules that use regular expressions](#regex-rules).

### Write good URL conditions

Take care when writing rules to always match an entire domain. Otherwise, your
rule may match in situations that are unexpected. For example, when using the
pattern matching syntax:

* `google.com` incorrectly matches `https://example.com/?param=google.com`
* `||google.com` incorrectly matches `https://google.company`
* `https://www.google.com` incorrectly matches `https://example.com/?param=https://www.google.com`

Consider using:

* `||google.com/`, which matches all paths and all subdomains.
* `|https://www.google.com/` which matches all paths and no subdomains.

Similarly, use the `^` and `/` characters to anchor a regular expression. For
example, `^https:\/\/www\.google\.com\/` matches any path on
https://www.google.com.

## Rule evaluation

DNR rules are applied by the browser across various stages of the network request lifecycle.

### Before the request

Before a request is made, an extension can block or redirect (including upgrading the scheme from HTTP to HTTPS) it with a matching rule.

For each extension, the browser determines a list of matching rules. Rules with a `modifyHeaders` action are not included here as they will be handled later. Additionally, rules with a `responseHeaders` condition will be considered later (when response headers are available) and are not included.

Then, for each extension, Chrome picks at most one candidate per request. Chrome finds a matching rule, by ordering all matching rules by priority. Rules with the same priority are ordered by action (`allow` or `allowAllRequests` > `block` > `upgradeScheme` > `redirect`).

If the candidate is an `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rule, or the frame the request is being made in previously matched an `allowAllRequests` rule of higher or equal priority from this extension, the request is "allowed" and the extension won't have any effect on the request.

If more than one extension wants to block or redirect this request, a single action to take is chosen. Chrome does this by sorting the rules in the order `block` > `redirect` or `upgradeScheme` > `allow` or `allowAllRequests`. If two rules are of the same type, Chrome chooses the rule from the most recently installed extension.

### Before request headers are sent

Before Chrome sends request headers to the server, the headers are updated based on matching `modifyHeaders` rules.

Within a single extension, Chrome builds the list of modifications to perform by finding all matching `modifyHeaders` rules. Similar to before, only rules which have a higher priority than any matching `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rules are included.

These rules are applied by Chrome in an order such that rules from a more recently installed extension are always evaluated before rules from an older extension. Additionally, rules of a higher priority from one extension are always applied before rules of a lower priority from the same extension. Notably, even across extensions:

* If a rule appends to a header, then lower priority rules can only append to that header. Set and remove operations are not allowed.
* If a rule sets a header, then only lower priority rules from the same extension can append to that header. No other modifications are allowed.
* If a rule removes a header, then lower priority rules cannot further modify the header.

### Once a response is received

Once the response headers have been received, Chrome evaluates rules with a `responseHeaders` condition.

After sorting these rules by `action` and `priority` and excluding any rules made redundant by a matching `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rule (this happens identically to the steps in "Before the request"), Chrome may block or redirect the request on behalf of an extension.

Note that if a request made it to this stage, the request has already been sent to the server and the server has received data like the request body. A block or redirect rule with a response headers condition will still run–but cannot actually block or redirect the request.

In the case of a block rule, this is handled by the page which made the request receiving a blocked response and Chrome terminating the request early. In the case of a redirect rule, Chrome makes a new request to the redirected URL. Make sure to consider if these behaviors meet the privacy expectations for your extension.

If the request is not blocked or redirected, Chrome applies any `modifyHeaders` rules. Applying modifications to response headers works in the same way as described in "Before request headers are sent". Applying modifications to request headers does nothing, since the request has already been made.

## Safe rules

Safe rules are defined as rules with an action of `block`, `allow`,
`allowAllRequests` or `upgradeScheme`. These rules are subject to an increased
dynamic rules [quota](#dynamic-rules).

## Rule limits

There is a performance overhead to loading and evaluating rules in the browser,
so some limits apply when using the API. Limits depend on the type of
rule you're using.

### Static rules

Static rules are those specified in rule files declared in the manifest file. An extension can specify up to 100 static [rulesets](#type-Ruleset) as part of the `"rule_resources"` manifest key, but only 50 of these rulesets can be enabled at a time. The latter is called the [`MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS). Collectively, those rulesets are guaranteed at least 30,000 rules. This is called the [`GUARANTEED_MINIMUM_STATIC_RULES`](#property-GUARANTEED_MINIMUM_STATIC_RULES).

The number of rules available after that depends on how many rules are enabled by all the extensions installed on a user's browser. You can find this number at runtime by calling [`getAvailableStaticRuleCount()`](#method-getAvailableStaticRuleCount). You can see [an example of this](#update-static-rulesets) under [code examples](#code-examples).

### Session rules

An extension can have up to 5000 session rules. This is exposed as the
[`MAX_NUMBER_OF_SESSION_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_SESSION_RULES).

Before Chrome 120, there was a limit of 5000 combined dynamic and session rules.

### Dynamic rules

An extension can have at least 5000 dynamic rules. This is exposed as the
[`MAX_NUMBER_OF_UNSAFE_DYNAMIC_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_UNSAFE_DYNAMIC_RULES).

Starting in Chrome 121, there is a larger limit of 30,000 rules available for [safe](#safe_rules) dynamic rules,
exposed as the [`MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES`](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES). Any
unsafe rules added within the limit of 5000 will also count towards this limit.

Before Chrome 120, there was a 5000 combined dynamic and session rules limit.

### Rules that use regular expressions

All types of rules can use regular expressions; however, the total number of regular expression rules of each type cannot exceed 1000. This is called the [MAX\_NUMBER\_OF\_REGEX\_RULES](#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_REGEX_RULES).

Additionally, each rule must be less than 2KB once compiled. This roughly correlates with the complexity of the rule. If you try to load a rule that exceeds this limit, you will see a warning like the following and the rule will be ignored.

```
rules_1.json: Rule with id 1 specified a more complex regex than allowed
as part of the "regexFilter" key.

```
## Interactions with service workers

A declarativeNetRequest only applies to requests that reach the network stack. This includes responses from the HTTP cache, but may not include responses that go through a service worker's `onfetch` handler. declarativeNetRequest won't affect responses generated by the service worker or retrieved from `CacheStorage`, but it will affect calls to `fetch()` made in a service worker.

## Web accessible resources

A declarativeNetRequest rule cannot redirect from a public resource request to a resource that is not web accessible. Doing so triggers an error. This is true even if the specified web accessible resource is owned by the redirecting extension. To declare resources for declarativeNetRequest, use the manifest's [`"web_accessible_resources"`](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) array.

## Header modification

The append operation is only supported for the following headers: `accept`, `accept-encoding`, `accept-language`, `access-control-request-headers`, `cache-control`, `connection`, `content-language`, `cookie`, `forwarded`, `if-match`, `if-none-match`, `keep-alive`, `range`, `te`, `trailer`, `transfer-encoding`, `upgrade`, `user-agent`, `via`, `want-digest`, `x-forwarded-for`.

## Examples

### Code examples

#### Update dynamic rules

The following example shows how to call `updateDynamicRules()`. The procedure for `updateSessionRules()` is the same.

```
// Get arrays containing new and old rules
const newRules = await getNewRules();
const oldRules = await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getDynamicRules();
const oldRuleIds = oldRules.map(rule => rule.id);

// Use the arrays to update the dynamic rules
await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules({
  removeRuleIds: oldRuleIds,
  addRules: newRules
});

```
#### Update static rulesets

The following example shows how to enable and disable rulesets while considering the number of available and the maximum number of enabled static rulesets. You would do this when the number of static rules you need exceeds the number allowed. For this to work, some of your rulesets should be installed with some of your rulesets disabled (setting `"Enabled"` to `false` within the manifest file).

```
async function updateStaticRules(enableRulesetIds, disableCandidateIds) {
  // Create the options structure for the call to updateEnabledRulesets()
  let options = { enableRulesetIds: enableRulesetIds }
  // Get the number of enabled static rules
  const enabledStaticCount = await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.getEnabledRulesets();
  // Compare rule counts to determine if anything needs to be disabled so that
  // new rules can be enabled
  const proposedCount = enableRulesetIds.length;
  if (enabledStaticCount + proposedCount > chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENABLED_STATIC_RULESETS) {
    options.disableRulesetIds = disableCandidateIds
  }
  // Update the enabled static rules
  await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateEnabledRulesets(options);
}

```
### Rule examples

The following examples illustrate how Chrome prioritizes rules in an extension. When reviewing them, you may want to open the [prioritization](#implementation-matching-algorithm) rules in a separate window.

#### The "priority" key

These examples require [host permission](/docs/extensions/mv3/declare_permissions) to `*://*.example.com/*`.

To work out the priority of a particular URL, look at the (developer-defined) `"priority"` key, the `"action"` key and the `"urlFilter"` key. These examples refer to the example rule file shown below them.

Navigation to https://google.com
Two rules cover this URL: the rules with IDs 1 and 4. The rule with ID 1 applies because `"block"` actions have a higher priority than `"redirect"` actions. The remaining rules don't apply because they are for longer URLs.
Navigation to https://google.com/1234
Because of the longer URL, the rule with ID 2 now matches in addition to the rules with IDs 1 and 4. The rule with ID 2 applies because `"allow"` has a higher priority than `"block"` and `"redirect"`.
Navigation to https://google.com/12345
All four rules match this URL. The rule with ID 3 applies because its developer-defined priority is the highest of the group.

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "block" },
    "condition": {"urlFilter": "||google.com/", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "allow" },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/123", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "priority": 2,
    "action": { "type": "block" },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/12345", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "priority": 1,
    "action": { "type": "redirect", "redirect": { "url": "https://example.com" } },
    "condition": { "urlFilter": "||google.com/", "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"] }
  },
]

```
#### Redirects

The example below requires [host permission](/docs/extensions/mv3/declare_permissions) to `*://*.example.com/*`.

The following example shows how to redirect a request from example.com to a page within the extension itself. The extension path `/a.jpg` resolves to `chrome-extension://EXTENSION_ID/a.jpg`, where `EXTENSION_ID` is the ID of your extension. For this to work the manifest should declare `/a.jpg` as a [web accessible resource](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources).

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": { "type": "redirect", "redirect": { "extensionPath": "/a.jpg" } },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||https://www.example.com/",
    "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"]
  }
}

```

The following uses the `"transform"` key to redirect to a subdomain of example.com. It uses a domain name anchor ("||") to intercept requests with any scheme from example.com. The `"scheme"` key in `"transform"` specifies that redirects to the subdomain will always use "https".

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "redirect",
    "redirect": {
      "transform": { "scheme": "https", "host": "new.example.com" }
    }
  },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||example.com/",
    "resourceTypes": ["main_frame"]
  }
}

```

The following example uses regular expressions to redirect from `https://www.abc.xyz.com/path` to `https://abc.xyz.com/path`. In the `"regexFilter"` key, notice how periods are escaped and that the capturing group selects either "abc" or "def". The `"regexSubstitution"` key specifies the first returned match of the regular expression using "\1". In this case, "abc" is captured from the redirected URL and placed in the substitution.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "redirect",
    "redirect": {
      "regexSubstitution": "https://\\1.xyz.com/"
    }
  },
  "condition": {
    "regexFilter": "^https://www\\.(abc|def)\\.xyz\\.com/",
    "resourceTypes": [
      "main_frame"
    ]
  }
}

```
#### Headers

The following example removes all cookies from both a main frame and any sub frames.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": {
    "type": "modifyHeaders",
    "requestHeaders": [{ "header": "cookie", "operation": "remove" }]
  },
  "condition": { "resourceTypes": ["main_frame", "sub_frame"] }
}

```
## Types

### DomainType

This describes whether the request is first or third party to the frame in which it originated. A request is said to be first party if it has the same domain (eTLD+1) as the frame in which the request originated.

 The network request is first party to the frame in which it originated.

"thirdParty"   
 The network request is third party to the frame in which it originated.

* excludedTabIds

  number[] optional

  Chrome 92+

  List of [`tabs.Tab.id`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-Tab-id) which the rule should not match.

Only supported for session-scoped rules.
* initiatorDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will only match network requests originating from the list of `initiatorDomains`. If the list is omitted, the rule is applied to requests from all domains. An empty list is not allowed.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + This matches against the request initiator and not the request url.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also matched.
* isUrlFilterCaseSensitive

  boolean optional

  Whether the `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` (whichever is specified) is case sensitive. Default is false.

  Note: Only one of `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` can be specified.

  Note: The `regexFilter` must be composed of only ASCII characters. This is matched against a url where the host is encoded in the punycode format (in case of internationalized domains) and any other non-ascii characters are url encoded in utf-8.
* requestDomains

  string[] optional

  Chrome 101+

  The rule will only match network requests when the domain matches one from the list of `requestDomains`. If the list is omitted, the rule is applied to requests from all domains. An empty list is not allowed.

  Notes:

  + Sub-domains like "a.example.com" are also allowed.
  + The entries must consist of only ascii characters.
  + Use punycode encoding for internationalized domains.
  + Sub-domains of the listed domains are also matched.
* requestMethods

  [RequestMethod](#type-RequestMethod)[] optional

  Chrome 91+

  List of HTTP request methods which the rule can match. An empty list is not allowed.

  Note: Specifying a `requestMethods` rule condition will also exclude non-HTTP(s) requests, whereas specifying `excludedRequestMethods` will not.
* resourceTypes

  [ResourceType](#type-ResourceType)[] optional

  List of resource types which the rule can match. An empty list is not allowed.

  Note: this must be specified for `allowAllRequests` rules and may only include the `sub_frame` and `main_frame` resource types.

* tabIds

  number[] optional

  Chrome 92+

  List of [`tabs.Tab.id`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-Tab-id) which the rule should match. An ID of [`tabs.TAB_ID_NONE`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#property-TAB_ID_NONE) matches requests which don't originate from a tab. An empty list is not allowed. Only supported for session-scoped rules.
* urlFilter

  string optional

  The pattern which is matched against the network request url. Supported constructs:

  **'\*'** : Wildcard: Matches any number of characters.

  **'|'** : Left/right anchor: If used at either end of the pattern, specifies the beginning/end of the url respectively.

  **'||'** : Domain name anchor: If used at the beginning of the pattern, specifies the start of a (sub-)domain of the URL.

  **'^'** : Separator character: This matches anything except a letter, a digit, or one of the following: `_`, `-`, `.`, or `%`. This also match the end of the URL.

  Therefore `urlFilter` is composed of the following parts: (optional Left/Domain name anchor) + pattern + (optional Right anchor).

  If omitted, all urls are matched. An empty string is not allowed.

  A pattern beginning with `||*` is not allowed. Use `*` instead.

  Note: Only one of `urlFilter` or `regexFilter` can be specified.

  Note: The `urlFilter` must be composed of only ASCII characters. This is matched against a url where the host is encoded in the punycode format (in case of internationalized domains) and any other non-ascii characters are url encoded in utf-8. For example, when the request url is http://abc.рф?q=ф, the `urlFilter` will be matched against the url http://abc.xn--p1ai/?q=%D1%84.

  Chrome 91+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### updateStaticRules()

Promise
Chrome 111+

```
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateStaticRules(  
  options: [UpdateStaticRulesOptions](#type-UpdateStaticRulesOptions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Disables and enables individual static rules in a [`Ruleset`](#type-Ruleset). Changes to rules belonging to a disabled [`Ruleset`](#type-Ruleset) will take effect the next time that it becomes enabled.

#### Parameters

* options

  [UpdateStaticRulesOptions](#type-UpdateStaticRulesOptions)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onRuleMatchedDebug

```
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.onRuleMatchedDebug.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when a rule is matched with a request. Only available for unpacked extensions with the `"declarativeNetRequestFeedback"` permission as this is intended to be used for debugging purposes only.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (info: [MatchedRuleInfoDebug](#type-MatchedRuleInfoDebug)) => void

## Description

The `chrome.events` namespace contains common types used by APIs dispatching events to notify you when something interesting happens.

## Concepts and usage

An `Event` is an object that lets you be notified when something interesting happens. Here's an
example of using the `chrome.alarms.onAlarm` event to be notified whenever an alarm has elapsed:

```
chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener((alarm) => {
  appendToLog(`alarms.onAlarm -- name: ${alarm.name}, scheduledTime: ${alarm.scheduledTime}`);
});

```

As the example shows, you register for notification using `addListener()`. The argument to
`addListener()` is always a function that you define to handle the event, but the parameters to the
function depend on which event you're handling. Checking the documentation for [`alarms.onAlarm`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms#event-onAlarm),
you can see that the function has a single parameter: an [`alarms.Alarm`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms#type-Alarm) object that has details
about the elapsed alarm.

Example APIs using Events: [alarms](/docs/extensions/reference/api/alarms), [i18n](/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n), [identity](/docs/extensions/reference/api/identity), [runtime](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime). Most [chrome
APIs](/docs/extensions/reference/api) do.

### Declarative Event Handlers

The declarative event handlers provide a means to define rules consisting of declarative conditions
and actions. Conditions are evaluated in the browser rather than the JavaScript engine which reduces
roundtrip latencies and allows for very high efficiency.

Declarative event handlers are used for example in the
[Declarative Content API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeContent). This page describes the underlying concepts of all declarative event
handlers.

#### Rules

The simplest possible rule consists of one or more conditions and one or more actions:

```
const rule = {
  conditions: [ /* my conditions */ ],
  actions: [ /* my actions */ ]
};

```

If any of the conditions is fulfilled, all actions are executed.

In addition to conditions and actions you may give each rule an identifier, which simplifies
unregistering previously registered rules, and a priority to define precedences among rules.
Priorities are only considered if rules conflict each other or need to be executed in a specific
order. Actions are executed in descending order of the priority of their rules.

```
const rule = {
  id: "my rule",  // optional, will be generated if not set.
  priority: 100,  // optional, defaults to 100.
  conditions: [ /* my conditions */ ],
  actions: [ /* my actions */ ]
};

```
#### Event objects

Event objects may support rules. These event objects don't call a callback function when
events happen but test whether any registered rule has at least one fulfilled condition and execute
the actions associated with this rule. Event objects supporting the declarative API have three
relevant methods: [`events.Event.addRules()`](#method-Event-addRules), [`events.Event.removeRules()`](#method-Event-removeRules), and
[`events.Event.getRules()`](#method-Event-getRules).

#### Add rules

To add rules call the `addRules()` function of the event object. It takes an array of rule instances
as its first parameter and a callback function that is called on completion.

```
const rule_list = [rule1, rule2, ...];
addRules(rule_list, (details) => {...});

```

If the rules were inserted successfully, the `details` parameter contains an array of inserted rules
appearing in the same order as in the passed `rule_list` where the optional parameters `id` and
`priority` were filled with the generated values. If any rule is invalid, for example, because it contained
an invalid condition or action, none of the rules are added and the [runtime.lastError](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#property-lastError) variable
is set when the callback function is called. Each rule in `rule_list` must contain a unique
identifier that is not already used by another rule or an empty identifier.

#### Remove rules

To remove rules call the `removeRules()` function. It accepts an optional array of rule identifiers
as its first parameter and a callback function as its second parameter.

```
const rule_ids = ["id1", "id2", ...];
removeRules(rule_ids, () => {...});

```

If `rule_ids` is an array of identifiers, all rules having identifiers listed in the array are
removed. If `rule_ids` lists an identifier, that is unknown, this identifier is silently ignored. If
`rule_ids` is `undefined`, all registered rules of this extension are removed. The `callback()`
function is called when the rules were removed.

#### Retrieve rules

To retrieve a list of registered rules, call the `getRules()` function. It accepts an
optional array of rule identifiers with the same semantics as `removeRules()` and a callback function.

```
const rule_ids = ["id1", "id2", ...];
getRules(rule_ids, (details) => {...});

```

The `details` parameter passed to the `callback()` function refers to an array of rules including
filled optional parameters.

#### Performance

To achieve maximum performance, you should keep the following guidelines in mind.

**Register and unregister rules in bulk.** After each registration or unregistration, Chrome needs to
update internal data structures. This update is an expensive operation.

Instead of
```
const rule1 = {...};
const rule2 = {...};
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule1]);
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule2]);
```

Prefer
```
const rule1 = {...};
const rule2 = {...};
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule1, rule2]);
```

**Prefer substring matching over regular expressions in an [events.UrlFilter](#type-UrlFilter).**
Substring based matching is extremely fast.

Instead of
```
const match = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: {urlMatches: "example.com/[^?]*foo" }
});
```

Prefer
```
const match = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: {hostSuffix: "example.com", pathContains: "foo"}
});
```

If there are many rules that share the same actions, merge the rules into one.
Rules trigger their actions as soon as a single condition is fulfilled. This speeds up the
matching and reduces memory consumption for duplicate action sets.

Instead of
```
const condition1 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com' }
});
const condition2 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'foobar.com' }
});
const rule1 = { conditions: [condition1],
                actions: [new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()]
              };
const rule2 = { conditions: [condition2],
                actions: [new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()]
              };
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule1, rule2]);
```

Prefer
```
const condition1 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com' }
});
const condition2 = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'foobar.com' }
});
const rule = { conditions: [condition1, condition2],
              actions: [new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()]
             };
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule]);
```

### Filtered events

Filtered events are a mechanism that allows listeners to specify a subset of events that they are
interested in. A listener that uses a filter won't be invoked for events that don't pass the
filter, which makes the listening code more declarative and efficient. A [service worker](/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers) need
not be woken up to handle events it doesn't care about.

Filtered events are intended to allow a transition from manual filtering code.

Instead of
```
chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted.addListener((event) => {
  if (hasHostSuffix(event.url, 'google.com') ||
      hasHostSuffix(event.url, 'google.com.au')) {
    // ...
  }
});
```

Prefer
```
chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted.addListener((event) => {
  // ...
}, {url: [{hostSuffix: 'google.com'},
          {hostSuffix: 'google.com.au'}]});
```

Events support specific filters that are meaningful to that event. The list of filters that an event
supports will be listed in the documentation for that event in the "filters" section.

When matching URLs (as in the example above), event filters support the same URL matching
capabilities as expressible with a [`events.UrlFilter`](#type-UrlFilter), except for scheme and port matching.

### Rule

Description of a declarative rule for handling events.

#### Properties

* actions

  any[]

  List of actions that are triggered if one of the conditions is fulfilled.
* conditions

  any[]

  List of conditions that can trigger the actions.
* id

  string optional

  Optional identifier that allows referencing this rule.

  string[] optional

  Chrome 123+

  Matches if the host part of the URL is an IP address and is contained in any of the CIDR blocks specified in the array.
* hostContains

  string optional

  Matches if the host name of the URL contains a specified string. To test whether a host name component has a prefix 'foo', use hostContains: '.foo'. This matches 'www.foobar.com' and 'foo.com', because an implicit dot is added at the beginning of the host name. Similarly, hostContains can be used to match against component suffix ('foo.') and to exactly match against components ('.foo.'). Suffix- and exact-matching for the last components need to be done separately using hostSuffix, because no implicit dot is added at the end of the host name.
* hostEquals

  Matches if the URL without query segment and fragment identifier matches a specified regular expression. Port numbers are stripped from the URL if they match the default port number. The regular expressions use the [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/doc/syntax.txt).
* pathContains

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL contains a specified string.
* pathEquals

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL is equal to a specified string.
* pathPrefix

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL starts with a specified string.
* pathSuffix

  string optional

  Matches if the path segment of the URL ends with a specified string.
* ports

  (number | number[])[] optional

  Matches if the port of the URL is contained in any of the specified port lists. For example `[80, 443, [1000, 1200]]` matches all requests on port 80, 443 and in the range 1000-1200.
* queryContains

  string optional

  Matches if the query segment of the URL contains a specified string.
* queryEquals

  string optional

  [RunAt](#type-RunAt) optional

  The soonest that the JavaScript or CSS will be injected into the tab. Defaults to "document\_idle".
### RunAt

Chrome 44+

The soonest that the JavaScript or CSS will be injected into the tab.

#### Enum

"document\_start"   
 Script is injected after any files from css, but before any other DOM is constructed or any other script is run.

"document\_end"   
 Script is injected immediately after the DOM is complete, but before subresources like images and frames have loaded.

"document\_idle"   
 The browser chooses a time to inject the script between "document\_end" and immediately after the `window.onload` event fires. The exact moment of injection depends on how complex the document is and how long it is taking to load, and is optimized for page load speed. Content scripts running at "document\_idle" don't need to listen for the `window.onload` event; they are guaranteed to run after the DOM completes. If a script definitely needs to run after `window.onload`, the extension can check if `onload` has already fired by using the `document.readyState` property.

# chrome.history  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/history/

# chrome.history

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.history` API to interact with the browser's record of visited pages. You can add, remove, and query for URLs in the browser's history. To override the history page with your own version, see [Override Pages](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/ui/override-chrome-pages).

## Permissions

`history`  

To interact with the user's browser history, use the history API.

To use the history API, declare the `"history"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest). For
example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "history"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Transition types

The history API uses transition types to describe how the browser navigated to a particular URL
on a particular visit. For example, if a user visits a page by clicking a link on another page, the
transition type is "link". See the [reference content](#type-TransitionType) for a list of
transition types.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [history API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/history) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

### HistoryItem

An object encapsulating one result of a history query.

#### Properties

* id

  string

  The unique identifier for the item.
* lastVisitTime

  number optional

  When this page was last loaded, represented in milliseconds since the epoch.
* title

  string optional

  The title of the page when it was last loaded.
* typedCount

  number optional

  The number of times the user has navigated to this page by typing in the address.
* url

  string optional

  The URL navigated to by a user.
* visitCount

  number optional

  The number of times the user has navigated to this page.
### TransitionType

Chrome 44+

The [transition type](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/history/#transition_types) for this visit from its referrer.

#### Enum

"link"   
 The user arrived at this page by clicking a link on another page.

"typed"   
 The user arrived at this page by typing the URL in the address bar. This is also used for other explicit navigation actions.

"auto\_bookmark"   
 The user arrived at this page through a suggestion in the UI, for example, through a menu item.

"auto\_subframe"   
 The user arrived at this page through subframe navigation that they didn't request, such as through an ad loading in a frame on the previous page. These don't always generate new navigation entries in the back and forward menus.

"manual\_subframe"   
 The user arrived at this page by selecting something in a subframe.

"generated"   
 The user arrived at this page by typing in the address bar and selecting an entry that didn't look like a URL, such as a Google Search suggestion. For example, a match might have the URL of a Google Search result page, but it might appear to the user as "Search Google for ...". These are different from typed navigations because the user didn't type or see the destination URL. They're also related to keyword navigations.

"auto\_toplevel"   
 The page was specified in the command line or is the start page.

"form\_submit"   
 The user arrived at this page by filling out values in a form and submitting the form. Not all form submissions use this transition type.

"reload"   
 The user reloaded the page, either by clicking the reload button or by pressing Enter in the address bar. Session restore and Reopen closed tab also use this transition type.

"keyword"   
 The URL for this page was generated from a replaceable keyword other than the default search provider.

"keyword\_generated"   
 Corresponds to a visit generated for a keyword.

### UrlDetails

# chrome.i18n

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.i18n` infrastructure to implement internationalization across your whole app or extension.

## Manifest

If an extension has a `/_locales` directory, the [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) must define `"default_locale"`.

## Concepts and usage

You need to put all of its user-visible strings into a file named [`messages.json`](/docs/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats). Each time
you add a new locale, you add a messages file under a directory named `/_locales/_localeCode_`, where
*localeCode* is a code such as `en` for English.

Here's the file hierarchy for an internationalized extension that supports English (`en`), Spanish
(`es`), and Korean (`ko`):

### Support multiple languages

Say you have an extension with the files shown in the following figure:

To internationalize this extension, you name each user-visible string and put it into a messages
file. The extension's manifest, CSS files, and JavaScript code use each string's name to get its
localized version.

Here's what the extension looks like when it's internationalized (note that it still has only
English strings):

Some notes about internationalizing:

* You can use any of the [supported locales](#locales). If you use an unsupported locale, Google Chrome
  ignores it.
* In `manifest.json` and CSS files, refer to a string named *messagename* like this:

  ```
  __MSG_messagename__

  ```
* In your extension or app's JavaScript code, refer to a string named *messagename* like this:

  ```
  chrome.i18n.getMessage("messagename")

  ```
* In each call to `getMessage()`, you can supply up to 9 strings to be included in the message. See
  [Examples: getMessage](#getmessage) for details.
* Some messages, such as `@@bidi_dir` and `@@ui_locale`, are provided by the internationalization
  system. See the [Predefined messages](#overview-predefined) section for a full list of predefined message names.
* In `messages.json`, each user-visible string has a name, a "message" item, and an optional
  "description" item. The name is a key such as "extName" or "search\_string" that identifies the
  string. The "message" specifies the value of the string in this locale. The optional "description"
  provides help to translators, who might not be able to see how the string is used in your
  extension. For example:

  ```
  {
    "search_string": {
      "message": "hello%20world",
      "description": "The string we search for. Put %20 between words that go together."
    },
    ...
  }

  ```

For more information, see [Formats: Locale-Specific Messages](/docs/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats).

Once an extension is internationalized, translating it is straightforward. You copy `messages.json`,
translate it, and put the copy into a new directory under `/_locales`. For example, to support
Spanish, just put a translated copy of `messages.json` under `/_locales/es`. The following figure
shows the previous extension with a new Spanish translation.

### Predefined messages

The internationalization system provides a few predefined messages to help you localize. These
include `@@ui_locale`, so you can detect the current UI locale, and a few `@@bidi_...` messages that
let you detect the text direction. The latter messages have similar names to constants in the
[gadgets BIDI (bi-directional) API](https://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/i18n.html#BIDI).

The special message `@@extension_id` can be used in the CSS and JavaScript files, whether or not the
extension or app is localized. This message doesn't work in manifest files.

The following table describes each predefined message.

| Message name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@@extension_id` | The extension or app ID; you might use this string to construct URLs for resources inside the extension. Even unlocalized extensions can use this message.**Note:** You can't use this message in a manifest file. |
| `@@ui_locale` | The current locale; you might use this string to construct locale-specific URLs. |
| `@@bidi_dir` | The text direction for the current locale, either "ltr" for left-to-right languages such as English or "rtl" for right-to-left languages such as Arabic. |
| `@@bidi_reversed_dir` | If the `@@bidi_dir` is "ltr", then this is "rtl"; otherwise, it's "ltr". |
| `@@bidi_start_edge` | If the `@@bidi_dir` is "ltr", then this is "left"; otherwise, it's "right". |
| `@@bidi_end_edge` | If the `@@bidi_dir` is "ltr", then this is "right"; otherwise, it's "left". |

Here's an example of using `@@extension_id` in a CSS file to construct a URL:

```
body {
  background-image:url('chrome-extension://__MSG_@@extension_id__/background.png');
}

```

If the extension ID is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef, then the bold line in the previous code
snippet becomes:

```
  background-image:url('chrome-extension://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef/background.png');

```

Here's an example of using `@@bidi_*` messages in a CSS file:

```
body {
  direction: __MSG_@@bidi_dir__;
}

div#header {
  margin-bottom: 1.05em;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-bottom: 1.5em;
  padding-__MSG_@@bidi_start_edge__: 0;
  padding-__MSG_@@bidi_end_edge__: 1.5em;
  position: relative;
}

```

For left-to-right languages such as English, the bold lines become:

```
  dir: ltr;
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-right: 1.5em;

```
### Locales

You can choose from many locales, including some (such as `en`) that let a single translation support multiple variations of a language (such as `en_GB` and `en_US`).

You can localize your extension to any locale that is supported by the Chrome Web Store. If your locale is not listed here, choose the closest alternative. For example, if the default locale of your extension is `"de_CH"`, choose `"de"` in the Chrome Web Store.

| Locale code | Language (region) |
| --- | --- |
| ar | Arabic |
| am | Amharic |
| bg | Bulgarian |
| bn | Bengali |
| ca | Catalan |
| cs | Czech |
| da | Danish |
| de | German |
| el | Greek |
| en | English |
| en\_AU | English (Australia) |
| en\_GB | English (Great Britain) |

| zh\_TW | Chinese (Taiwan) |

### Search for messages

You don't have to define every string for every supported locale. As long as the default locale's
`messages.json` file has a value for every string, your extension or app will run no matter how
sparse a translation is. Here's how the extension system searches for a message:

1. Search the messages file (if any) for the user's preferred locale. For example, when Google
   Chrome's locale is set to British English (`en_GB`), the system first looks for the message in
   `/_locales/en_GB/messages.json`. If that file exists and the message is there, the system looks
   no further.
2. If the user's preferred locale has a region (that is, the locale has an underscore: \_), search
   the locale without that region. For example, if the `en_GB` messages file doesn't exist or
   doesn't contain the message, the system looks in the `en` messages file. If that file exists and
   the message is there, the system looks no further.
3. Search the messages file for the default locale. For example, if the extension's
   "default\_locale" is set to "es", and neither `/_locales/en_GB/messages.json` nor
   `/_locales/en/messages.json` contains the message, the extension uses the message from
   `/_locales/es/messages.json`.

In the following figure, the message named "colores" is in all three locales that the extension
supports, but "extName" is in only two of the locales. Wherever a user running Google Chrome in US
English sees the label "Colors", a user of British English sees "Colours". Both US English and
British English users see the extension name "Hello World". Because the default language is Spanish,
users running Google Chrome in any non-English language see the label "Colores" and the extension
name "Hola mundo".

### Set your browser's locale

To test translations, you might want to set your browser's locale. This section tells you how to set
the locale in [Windows](#windows), [Mac OS](#mac_os), [Linux](#linux), and [ChromeOS](#chromeos).

#### Windows

You can change the locale using either a locale-specific shortcut or the Google Chrome UI. The
shortcut approach is quicker, once you've set it up, and it lets you use several languages at once.

##### Use a locale-specific shortcut

To create and use a shortcut that launches Google Chrome with a particular locale:

1. Make a copy of the Google Chrome shortcut that's already on your desktop.
2. Rename the new shortcut to match the new locale.
3. Change the shortcut's properties so that the Target field specifies the `--lang` and
   `--user-data-dir` flags. The target should look something like this:

   ```
   path_to_chrome.exe --lang=locale --user-data-dir=c:\locale_profile_dir

   ```
4. Launch Google Chrome by double-clicking the shortcut.

For example, to create a shortcut that launches Google Chrome in Spanish (`es`), you might create a
shortcut named `chrome-es` that has the following target:

```
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=es --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-es

```

You can create as many shortcuts as you like, making it straightforward to test in multiple languages. For
example:

```
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=en --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-en
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=en_GB --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-en_GB
path_to_chrome.exe --lang=ko --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-profile-ko

```
##### Use the UI

Here's how to change the locale using the UI on Google Chrome for Windows:

1. App icon > **Options**
2. Choose the **Under the Hood** tab
3. Scroll to **Web Content**
4. Click **Change font and language settings**
5. Choose the **Languages** tab
6. Use the drop down to set the **Google Chrome language**
7. Restart Chrome

#### Mac OS

To change the locale on Mac, you use the system preferences.

1. From the Apple menu, choose **System Preferences**
2. Under the **Personal** section, choose **International**
3. Choose your language and location
4. Restart Chrome

#### Linux

To change the locale on Linux, first quit Google Chrome. Then, all in one line, set the LANGUAGE
environment variable and launch Google Chrome. For example:

```
LANGUAGE=es ./chrome

```
#### ChromeOS

To change the locale on ChromeOS:

1. From the system tray, choose **Settings**.
2. Under the **Languages and input** section, choose the **Language** drop-down.
3. If your language is not listed, click **Add languages** and add it.
4. Once added, click the 3-dot **More actions** menu item next to your language and choose
   **Display ChromeOS in this language**.
5. Click the **Restart** button that appears next to the set language to restart ChromeOS.

## Examples

You can find examples of internationalization in the [examples/api/i18n](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/_archive/mv2/api/i18n/) directory. For a
complete example, see [examples/extensions/news](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/_archive/mv2/extensions/news/). For other examples and for help in viewing the
source code, see [Samples](/docs/extensions/samples).

### getMessage()

The following code gets a localized message from the browser and displays it as a string. It
replaces two placeholders within the message with the strings "string1" and "string2".

```
function getMessage() {
  var message = chrome.i18n.getMessage("click_here", ["string1", "string2"]);
  document.getElementById("languageSpan").innerHTML = message;
}

```

Here's how you'd supply and use a single string:

```
  // In JavaScript code
  status.innerText = chrome.i18n.getMessage("error", errorDetails);

```
```
"error": {
  "message": "Error: $details$",
  "description": "Generic error template. Expects error parameter to be passed in.",
  "placeholders": {
    "details": {
      "content": "$1",
      "example": "Failed to fetch RSS feed."
    }
  }
}

```

For more information about placeholders, see the [Locale-Specific Messages](/docs/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats#placeholders) page. For details on
calling `getMessage()`, see the [API reference](#method-getMessage).

### getAcceptLanguages()

The following code gets accept-languages from the browser and displays them as a string by
separating each accept-language with ','.

```
function getAcceptLanguages() {
  chrome.i18n.getAcceptLanguages(function(languageList) {
    var languages = languageList.join(",");
    document.getElementById("languageSpan").innerHTML = languages;
  })
}

```

For details on calling `getAcceptLanguages()`, see the [API reference](#method-getAcceptLanguages).

### detectLanguage()

The following code detects up to 3 languages from the given string and displays the result as
strings separated by new lines.

```
function detectLanguage(inputText) {
  chrome.i18n.detectLanguage(inputText, function(result) {
    var outputLang = "Detected Language: ";
    var outputPercent = "Language Percentage: ";
    for(i = 0; i < result.languages.length; i++) {
      outputLang += result.languages[i].language + " ";
      outputPercent +=result.languages[i].percentage + " ";
    }
    document.getElementById("languageSpan").innerHTML = outputLang + "\n" + outputPercent + "\nReliable: " + result.isReliable;
  });
}

```

For more details on calling `detectLanguage(inputText)`, see the [API reference](#method-detectLanguage).

## Types

### LanguageCode

Chrome 47+

An ISO language code such as `en` or `fr`. For a complete list of languages supported by this method, see [kLanguageInfoTable](https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/third_party/cld/languages/internal/languages.cc). For an unknown language, `und` will be returned, which means that [percentage] of the text is unknown to CLD

#### Type

string

## Methods

### detectLanguage()

Promise
Chrome 47+

```
chrome.i18n.detectLanguage(  
  text: string,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Detects the language of the provided text using CLD.

#### Parameters

* text

  string

  User input string to be translated.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: object) => void
  ```

  + result

    object

    LanguageDetectionResult object that holds detected langugae reliability and array of DetectedLanguage

    - isReliable

      boolean

      CLD detected language reliability
    - languages

      object[]

      array of detectedLanguage

      * language

        string
      * percentage

        number

        The percentage of the detected language
#### Returns

* Promise<object>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getAcceptLanguages()

Promise

```
chrome.i18n.getAcceptLanguages(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Gets the accept-languages of the browser. This is different from the locale used by the browser; to get the locale, use [`i18n.getUILanguage`](#method-getUILanguage).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (languages: string[]) => void
  ```

  + languages

    string[]

    Array of LanguageCode
#### Returns

* Promise<[LanguageCode](#type-LanguageCode)[]>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getMessage()

```
chrome.i18n.getMessage(  
  messageName: string,  
  substitutions?: any,  
  options?: object,  
)
```

Gets the localized string for the specified message. If the message is missing, this method returns an empty string (''). If the format of the `getMessage()` call is wrong — for example, *messageName* is not a string or the *substitutions* array has more than 9 elements — this method returns `undefined`.

#### Parameters

* messageName

  string

  The name of the message, as specified in the [`messages.json`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/how-to/ui/localization-message-formats) file.
* substitutions

  any optional

  Up to 9 substitution strings, if the message requires any.
* options

  object optional

  Chrome 79+

  + escapeLt

    boolean optional

    Escape `<` in translation to `&lt;`. This applies only to the message itself, not to the placeholders. Developers might want to use this if the translation is used in an HTML context. Closure Templates used with Closure Compiler generate this automatically.
#### Returns

* string

  Message localized for current locale.
### getUILanguage()

```
chrome.i18n.getUILanguage()
```

Gets the browser UI language of the browser. This is different from [`i18n.getAcceptLanguages`](#method-getAcceptLanguages) which returns the preferred user languages.

#### Returns

* string

  The browser UI language code such as en-US or fr-FR.

# Manifest file format

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Every extension must have a `manifest.json` file in its root directory that
lists important information about the structure and behavior of that extension.
This page explains the structure of extension manifests and the features they
can include.

## Examples

The following example manifests show the basic manifest structure and some
commonly used features as a starting point for creating your own manifest:

}

```

## Manifest keys

The following is a list of all supported manifest keys.

### Keys required by the Extensions platform

An integer specifying the version of the manifest file format that your
extension uses. The only supported value is `3`.
`"name"`
A string that identifies the extension in the [Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore), the install dialog, and
the user's Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions`). The
maximum length is 75 characters. For information on using locale-specific names,
see [Internationalization](/docs/extensions/reference/api/i18n).

options page. For more information, see [Give users
options](/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page).
`"options_ui"`
Specifies a path to an HTML file that lets a user change extension options
from the Chrome Extensions page. For more information, see [Embedded
options](/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#embedded_options).
`"permissions"`
Enables use of particular extension APIs. See [Permissions](/docs/extensions/reference/permissions)
for a general explanation. Reference pages for individual APIs list the
permissions they require.
`"requirements"`
Lists technologies required to use the extension. For a list of supported
requirements, see [Requirements](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/requirements).
`"sandbox"`
Defines a set of extension pages that don't have access to extension APIs or
direct access to non-sandboxed pages. For more information, see
[Sandbox](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/sandbox).
`"short_name"`
A string containing a shortened version of the extension's name to be used
when character space is limited. The maximum length is 12 characters. If this is
undefined, a truncated version of the "name" key displays instead.
`"side_panel"`
Identifies an HTML file to display in a
[sidePanel](/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel).
`"storage"`
Declares a JSON schema for the [managed storage
area](/docs/extensions/reference/storage#property-managed). For more
information, see [Manifest for storage areas](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/storage).

`"build rc2"`. If this is unspecified, the "version" value displays on the
extension management page instead.
`"web_accessible_resources"`
Defines files within the extension that can be accessed by web pages or other
extensions. For more information, see [Web Accessible
Resources](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/web-accessible-resources).
### Optional ChromeOS keys

`"file_browser_handlers"`
Provides access to the [`fileBrowserHandler`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/fileBrowserHandler)
API, which lets extensions access the ChromeOS file browser.
`"file_handlers"`
Specifies file types for ChromeOS extensions to handle. For more information,
see [`file_handlers`](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/file-handlers).
`"file_system_provider_capabilities"`
Allows access to the [`fileSystemProvider`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/fileSystemProvider)
API, which lets extensions create file systems that ChromeOS can use.
`"input_components"`

# Manifest - background

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

An optional manifest key used to specify a javascript file as the extension service worker. A service worker is a background script that acts as the extension's main event handler. For more information, visit the [more comprehensive introduction to service workers](/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers#manifest).

```
{
  ...
   "background": {
      "service_worker": "service-worker.js",
      "type": "module"
    },
  ...

# Overriding Chrome settings  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

# Overriding Chrome settings

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Settings overrides are a way for extensions to override selected Chrome settings. The API is
available on Windows and Mac in all current versions of Chrome.

## Homepage, search provider, and startup pages

Here is an example of how [homepage](#homepage), [search provider](#search_provider), and [startup pages](#startup_pages) can be modified
in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest). Any domain used in the settings API must be [verified](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35179) (via
Google Search Console) by the same developer account publishing the extension. Note that if you
verify ownership for a domain (for example, https://example.com) you can use any subdomain or page
(for example, https://app.example.com or https://example.com/page.html) within your extension.

Using the settings override permission while also requesting any additional capabilities or permissions is inconsistent with our single purpose policy. When Chrome detects that an item is potentially violating our single purpose policy, a confirmation dialog is shown to the user. Extensions that limit themselves to only modifying a single setting without seeking additional capabilities or permissions do not get a confirmation dialog.

This applies to Chrome 107 and later.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "chrome_settings_overrides": {
    "homepage": "https://www.homepage.com",
    "search_provider": {
        "name": "name.__MSG_url_domain__",
        "keyword": "keyword.__MSG_url_domain__",
        "search_url": "https://www.foo.__MSG_url_domain__/s?q={searchTerms}",
        "favicon_url": "https://www.foo.__MSG_url_domain__/favicon.ico",
        "suggest_url": "https://www.foo.__MSG_url_domain__/suggest?q={searchTerms}",
        "instant_url": "https://www.foo.__MSG_url_domain__/instant?q={searchTerms}",
        "image_url": "https://www.foo.__MSG_url_domain__/image?q={searchTerms}",
        "search_url_post_params": "search_lang=__MSG_url_domain__",
        "suggest_url_post_params": "suggest_lang=__MSG_url_domain__",
        "instant_url_post_params": "instant_lang=__MSG_url_domain__",
        "image_url_post_params": "image_lang=__MSG_url_domain__",
        "alternate_urls": [
          "https://www.moo.__MSG_url_domain__/s?q={searchTerms}",
          "https://www.noo.__MSG_url_domain__/s?q={searchTerms}"
        ],
        "encoding": "UTF-8",
        "is_default": true
    },
    "startup_pages": ["https://www.startup.com"]
   },
   "default_locale": "de",
   ...
}

```
## Customizing values

Values in the manifest can be customized in the following ways:

* All values of the `search_provider`, `homepage`, and `startup_pages` properties can be localized
  using the [`chrome.i18n` API](/docs/extensions/reference/i18n).
* For [external extensions](/docs/extensions/mv3/external_extensions), the `search_provider`, `homepage` and `startup_pages` URL values can
  be parametrized using a registry key. Create a new registry entry next to the
  `"update_url"` key (see instructions [here](/docs/extensions/mv3/external_extensions#registry)). The key name is `"install_parameter"`, the value
  is an arbitrary string:

  ```
  {
    "update_url": "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx",
    "install_parameter": "Value"
  }

  ```

  All occurrences of the substring `"__PARAM__"` in the manifest URLs will be substituted with the
  `"install_parameter"` value. If `"install_parameter"` is absent, occurrences of `"__PARAM__"` are
  removed. Note that `"__PARAM__"` cannot be part of the hostname. It needs to occur after the
  first '/' in the URL.

## Reference

# Manifest - content scripts  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/content-scripts

# Manifest - content scripts

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The `"content_scripts"` key specifies a statically loaded JavaScript or CSS file to be used every time a page is opened that matches a certain [URL pattern](/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns). Extensions can also inject content scripts programmatically, see [Injecting Scripts](/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts) for details.

## Manifest

These are the supported keys for `"content_scripts"`. Only the `"matches"` key and either `"js"` or `"css"` are required.

manifest.json

```
{
 "name": "My extension",
 ...
 "content_scripts": [
   {
     "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
     "css": ["my-styles.css"],
     "js": ["content-script.js"],
     "exclude_matches": ["*://*/*foo*"],
     "include_globs": ["*example.com/???s/*"],
     "exclude_globs": ["*bar*"],     
     "all_frames": false,
     "match_origin_as_fallback": false,
     "match_about_blank": false,
     "run_at": "document_idle",
     "world": "ISOLATED",
   }
 ],
 ...
}

```
## Files

Each file must contain a relative path to a resource in the extension's root directory. Leading slashes (`/`) are automatically trimmed. The [`"run_at"`](#world-timings) key specifies when each file will be injected.

`"css"` - Array
*Optional*. An array of CSS file paths, injected in the order of this array, and before any DOM construction or page rendering occurs.
`"js"` - Array,
*Optional*. An array of JavaScript file paths, injected in the order they appear in this array, after css files are injected. Each string in the array must be a relative path to a resource in the extension's root directory. Leading slashes ('/') are automatically trimmed.
## Match URLs

Only the `"matches"` property is required. Then you can use `"exclude_matches"`, `"include_globs"`, and `"exclude_globs"` to customize which URLs to inject code into. The `"matches"` key will [trigger a warning](/docs/extensions/mv3/permission_warnings).

`"matches"` - Array
*Required*. Specifies which URL patterns to inject the content scripts into. See [Match Patterns](/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns) for syntax.
`"exclude_matches"` - Array
*Optional*. Excludes the URL patterns to inject the content scripts into. See [Match Patterns](/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns) for syntax.
`"include_globs"` - Array
*Optional*. Applied after matches to include only those URLs that also match this glob. Intended to emulate the [@include](https://wiki.greasespot.net/Metadata_Block#.40include) Greasemonkey keyword.
`"exclude_globs"` - Array
*Optional*. Applied after matches to exclude URLs that match this glob. Intended to emulate the [@exclude](https://wiki.greasespot.net/Metadata_Block#.40exclude) Greasemonkey keyword.

Glob URLs are those that contain "wildcards" **\*** and question marks. The wildcard **\*** matches any string of any length, including an empty string, while the question mark **?** matches any single character.

The content script is injected into a page if:

* Its URL matches any `"matches"` and `"include_globs"` patterns.
* And the URL doesn't match `"exclude_matches"` or `"exclude_globs"` patterns.

### Globs and URL matching examples

#### `"include_globs"`

manifest.json

```
{
  ...
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
      "include_globs": ["https://???.example.com/foo/*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

Matches
```
https://www.example.com/foo/bar
https://the.example.com/foo/
```

Does not match
```
https://my.example.com/foo/bar
https://example.com/foo/*
https://www.example.com/foo
```

manifest.json

```
{
  ...
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
      "include_globs": ["*example.com/???s/*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

Matches
```
https://www.example.com/arts/index.html
https://www.example.com/jobs/index.html
```

Does not match
```
https://www.example.com/sports/index.html
https://www.example.com/music/index.html
```

#### `"exclude_globs"`

manifest.json

```
{
  ...
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
      "exclude_globs": ["*science*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

Matches
```
https://history.example.com
https://.example.com/music
```

Does not match
```
https://science.example.com
https://www.example.com/science
```

#### Advanced customization example

manifest.json

```
{
  ...
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
      "exclude_matches": ["*://*/*business*"],
      "include_globs": ["*example.com/???s/*"],
      "exclude_globs": ["*science*"],
      "js": ["content-script.js"]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

Matches
```
https://www.example.com/arts/index.html
https://.example.com/jobs/index.html
```

Does not match
```
https://science.example.com
https://www.example.com/jobs/business
https://www.example.com/science
```

## Frames

The `"all_frames"` key specifies if the content script should be injected into all frames matching the specified URL requirements. If set to `false` it will only inject into the topmost frame. It can be used along with `"match_about_blank"` to inject into an `about:blank` frame.

To inject into other frames like `data:`, `blob:`, and `filesystem:`, set the `"match_origin_as_fallback"` to `true`. For details, see [Inject in related frames](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#injecting-in-related-frames)

`"all_frames"` Boolean
*Optional*. Defaults to `false`, meaning that only the top frame is matched. If set to true, it will inject into all frames, even if the frame is not the topmost frame in the tab. Each frame is checked independently for URL requirements, it won't inject into child frames if the URL requirements are not met.
`"match_about_blank"`- Boolean
*Optional*. Defaults to `false`. Whether the script should inject into an `about:blank` frame where the parent URL matches one of the patterns declared in `"matches"`.
`"match_origin_as_fallback"` - Boolean
*Optional*. Defaults to `false`. Whether the script should inject in frames that were created by a matching origin, but whose URL or origin may not directly match the pattern. These include frames with different schemes, such as `about:`, `data:`, `blob:`, and `filesystem:`.
## Run time and execution environment

By default, content scripts are injected when the document and all resources are finished loading, and live in a private isolated execution environment that isn't accessible to the page or other extensions. You can change these defaults in the following keys:

[`"run_at"`](/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes#type-RunAt) - `document_start` | `document_end` | `document_idle`
*Optional*. Specifies when the script should be injected into the page. It corresponds with the loading states of [Document.readyState](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState):

* `"document_start"`: the DOM is still loading.
* `"document_end"`: the page's resources are still loading
* `"document_idle"`: the DOM and resources have finished loading. This is the default.

[`"world"`](/docs/extensions/reference/scripting#type-ExecutionWorld) - `ISOLATED` | `MAIN`
*Optional*. The JavaScript world for a script to execute within. Defaults to `"ISOLATED"`, which is the execution environment unique to the content script. Choosing the `"MAIN"` world means the script will share the execution environment with the host page's JavaScript. See [Work in isolated worlds](/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts#isolated_world) to learn more.

# Manifest - Content Security Policy  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/content-security-policy

# Manifest - Content Security Policy

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

An optional manifest key containing a web platform [content security policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) which specifies restrictions on the scripts, styles, and other resources an extension can use. Within this manifest key, separate optional policies can be defined for both extension pages and sandboxed extension pages.

The "extension pages" policy applies to page and worker contexts in the extension. This would include the extension popup, background worker, and tabs with HTML pages or iframes that were opened by the extension. The sandbox policy applies to all pages specified as a [sandbox page](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/sandbox) in the manifest.

## Default Policy

If the content security policy is not defined by the user in the manifest, the default properties will be used for both extension pages and sandboxed extension pages.

These defaults are equivalent to specifying the following policies in your manifest:

```
{
  // ...
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self';",
    "sandbox": "sandbox allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-modals; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; child-src 'self';"
  }
  // ...
}

```

In this case, the extension will only load local scripts and objects from its own packaged resources. WebAssembly will be disabled, and the extension won't run inline Javascript or be able to evaluate strings as executable code. If a sandbox page is added, it will have more relaxed permissions for evaluating scripts from outside the extension.

## Minimum and customized Content Security Policies

Developers may add or remove rules for their extension, or use the minimum required content security policy, to fit the needs of their project.

### Extension Pages Policy

Chrome enforces a minimum content security policy for extension pages. It is equivalent to specifying the following policy in your manifest:

```
{
  // ...
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self';"
  }
  // ...
}

```

The `extension_pages` policy cannot be relaxed beyond this minimum value. In other words, you cannot add other script sources to directives, such as adding `'unsafe-eval'` to `script-src`. If you add a disallowed source to your extension's policy, Chrome will throw an error like this at install time:

```
'content_security_policy.extension_pages': Insecure CSP value "'unsafe-eval'" in directive 'script-src'.

```
### Sandbox Pages Policy

The default policy for sandboxed pages is much more lenient than with extension pages, as the sandbox page does not have access to extension APIs, or direct access to non-sandboxed pages. The sandbox content security policy can be customized as needed.

# Cross-origin embedder policy  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/cross-origin-embedder-policy

# Cross-origin embedder policy

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The `cross_origin_embedder_policy` manifest key lets the extension specify a value for the
[Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) (COEP) response header for requests to the extension's
origin. This includes the extension's service worker, popup, options page, tabs that are open to an extension resource, etc.

Together with [cross\_origin\_opener\_policy](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/cross_origin_opener_policy), this key allows the extension to opt
into [cross-origin isolation](/docs/extensions/mv3/cross-origin-isolation).

## Manifest declaration

The `cross_origin_embedder_policy` manifest key contains an object with one
property named `value` that takes a string. Chrome uses this string as the value of the
`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` header when serving resources from the extension's origin. For
example:

```
{
    ...
    "cross_origin_embedder_policy": {
      "value": "require-corp"
    },
    ...
}

```

# event\_rules

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The `event_rules` manifest property provides a mechanism to add rules that intercept, block, or
modify web requests in-flight using [declarativeWebRequest](/docs/extensions/mv2/reference/declarativeWebRequest) or take actions depending on the
content of a page, without requiring permission to read the page's content using
[declarativeContent](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeContent).

## Translating rules from javascript to manifest

The following defines a rule to display a page action if the current page has a video css tag in
javascript:

```
chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([{
  actions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowPageAction()
  ],
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher(
        {css: ["video"]}
    )
  ]
}]);

```

This is the same definition in the manifest:

```
{
  "name": "Sample extension",
  "event_rules": [{
    "event": "declarativeContent.onPageChanged",
    "actions": [{
      "type": "declarativeContent.ShowPageAction"
    }],
    "conditions": [{
      "type": "declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher",
      "css": ["video"]
    }]
  }],
  ...
}

# externally_connectable  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/externally-connectable

# externally\_connectable

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The `"externally_connectable"` manifest property declares which extensions and web pages can
connect to your extension using [`runtime.connect()`](/docs/extensions/reference/runtime#method-connect) and [`runtime.sendMessage()`](/docs/extensions/reference/runtime#method-sendMessage).

For a tutorial on message passing, see [cross-extension messaging](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging#external) and [sending messages
from web pages](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging#external-webpage).

## Connect without externally\_connectable

If the `externally_connectable` key is ***not*** declared in your extension's manifest, all extensions can connect, but no web pages can connect. As a consequence, when updating your manifest to use
`externally_connectable`, if `"ids": ["*"]` is not specified, then other extensions will
lose the ability to connect to your extension. This may be an unintended consequence, so keep it in
mind.

## Manifest

```
{
  "name": "My externally connectable extension",
  "externally_connectable": {
    "ids": [
      "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
      ...
    ],
    // If this field is not specified, no web pages can connect.
    "matches": [
      "https://*.google.com/*",
      "*://*.chromium.org/*",
      ...
    ],
    "accepts_tls_channel_id": false
  },
  ...
}

```
## Reference

The `"externally_connectable"` manifest key includes the following *optional* properties:

`"ids"`
The IDs of extensions that are allowed to connect. If left empty or unspecified, no extensions or apps can connect. The wildcard `"*"` will allow all extensions and apps to connect.
`"matches"`
The URL patterns for *web pages* that are allowed to connect. If left empty or unspecified, no web pages can connect. Patterns cannot include wildcard domains nor subdomains of [(effective) top-level domains](http://publicsuffix.org/list/), for example:

| ✅ Valid URLs | ❌ Invalid URLs |
| --- | --- |
| `*://example.com/` | `*://example.com/one/` |
| `http://*.example.org/*` | `<all_urls>` |
| `https://example.com/*` | `http://*/*` |

`"accepts_tls_channel_id"`
Enables the extension to use the TLS channel ID of the web page connecting to it. The web page must also opt to send the [TLS channel ID](/docs/extensions/runtime#property-MessageSender-tlsChannelId) to the extension by setting
`includeTlsChannelId` to `true` in runtime.connect's [connectInfo](/docs/extensions/reference/runtime#type-connect-connectInfo) or runtime.sendMessage's [options](/docs/extensions/reference/runtime#property-sendMessage-options-includeTlsChannelId). If set to `false`,
[runtime.MessageSender.tlsChannelId](/docs/extensions/runtime#property-MessageSender-tlsChannelId) will never be set under any circumstance.

This does not affect content scripts.

# file\_handlers

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

The `"file_handlers"` manifest key specifies file types to be handled by a ChromeOS extension. To process a file, use the web platform's [Launch Handler API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Launch_Handler_API). For extension specific information, see [File Handling](/docs/extensions/how-to/web-platform/file-handling-chromeos).

```
"file_handlers": [
  {
    "action": "/open_text.html",
    "name": "Plain text",
    "accept": {
      "text/plain": [".txt"]
    }
    "launch_type": "single-client"
  }
]

```

`"file_handlers"` (dictionary, optional)
Specifies the file types the extension can open.
`"action"` (string, required)
Specifies an HTML file to show when a file is opened. The file must be within your extension. Processing the file, whether it's displayed or used in some other way, is done with JavaScript using appropriate web platform APIs. This code must be in a separate JavaScript file included via a `<script>` tag.
`"name"` (string, required)
A user friendly description of the action.
`"accept"` (dictionary, required)
The file types that can be processed by the page specified in `"action"`. The items in the dictionary are a key/value pair where the key is a MIME type and the value is an array of file extensions. Only known MIME types are allowed for the key. Custom file types are allowed but the key for a custom type must be a known MIME type, and the mapping between the MIME type and the custom file type must be supported by the underlying operating system.
`"launch_type"` (object, optional)
Specifies whether multiple files should be opened in a single client or multiple clients. Valid values are `"single-client"` and `"multiple-clients"`. The default value is `"single-client"`.

# Manifest - Icons  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

# Manifest - Icons

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

One or more icons that represent the extension or theme. You should always provide a 128x128 icon;
it's used during installation and by the Chrome Web Store. Extensions should also provide a 48x48
icon, which is used in the extensions management page (chrome://extensions). You can also specify a
16x16 icon to be used as the favicon for an extension's pages.

Icons should generally be in PNG format, because PNG has the best support for transparency. They
can, however, be in any raster format supported by Blink, including BMP, GIF, ICO, and JPEG.

Here's an example of how to declare the icons in the manifest:

```
 "icons": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "32": "icon32.png",
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  },

```

# Manifest - Incognito  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/incognito

# Manifest - Incognito

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Use the `"incognito"` manifest key with either `"spanning"` or `"split"` to specify how this
extension will behave if allowed to run in incognito mode. Using `"not_allowed"` to prevent this
extension from being enabled in incognito mode.

## Spanning mode

The default mode is `"spanning"`, which means that the extension will run in a single
shared process. Any events or messages from an incognito tab will be sent to the shared process,
with an *incognito* flag indicating where it came from. Because incognito tabs cannot use this
shared process, an extension using the `"spanning"` incognito mode will not be able to load pages
from its extension package into the main frame of an incognito tab.

## Split mode

The `"split"` mode means that all pages in an incognito window will run in their own incognito
process. If the extension contains a background page, that will also run in the incognito process.
This incognito process runs along side the regular process, but has a separate memory-only cookie
store. Each process sees events and messages only from its own context (for example, the incognito
process will see only incognito tab updates). The processes are unable to communicate with each
other.

## Not allowed

The extension cannot be enabled in incognito mode. Available from Chrome 47.

## How to choose

As a rule of thumb, if your extension needs to load a tab in an incognito browser, use
*split* incognito behavior. If your extension needs to be logged into a remote server use
*spanning* incognito behavior.

[chrome.storage.sync](/docs/extensions/reference/storage#property-sync) and [chrome.storage.local](/docs/extensions/reference/storage#property-local) are *always* shared between regular and
incognito processes. It is recommended to use them for persisting your extension's settings.

# Manifest - input\_components

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

An optional Manifest key enabling the use of the [`input.ime` API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/input/ime) (Input Method Editor) for use with ChromeOS. This allows your extension to handle keystrokes, set the composition, and open assistive windows. Developers must also declare the `"input"` permission in the extension's `"permissions"` array.
The key accepts an array of objects: `name`, `id`, `language`, `layouts`, `input_view`, and `options_page` (Refer to the table below).

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Required name of the input component object. |
| `id` | string | Optional component object id. |
| `language` | string (or array of strings) | Optional specified language or list of applicable languages. Examples: "en", ["en", "pt"] |
| `layouts` | string (or array of strings) | Optional list of input methods. Note that ChromeOS only supports one layout per input method. If multiple layouts are specified, selection order is undefined. Extensions are therefore strongly encouraged to only specify one layout per input method. For keyboard layouts, a `xkb:` prefix indicates that this is a keyboard layout extension. |
| Example: ["us::eng"] |  |  |
| `input_view` | string | Optional string specifying an extension resource. |
| `options_page` | string | Optional string specifying an extension resource. If not provided, the default extension's options page will be used. |

```

# Manifest - key  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/key

# Manifest - key

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

This value maintains the unique ID of an extension, or theme when it is loaded
during development. The following are some common use cases:

* To configure a server to only accept requests from your Chrome Extension origin.
* So that other extensions or websites can [send messages](/docs/extensions/mv3/messaging#external-webpage) to your extension.
* So that a website can access the [`web_accessible_resources`](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) of your extension.

## Keep a consistent extension ID

Preserving a single ID is essential during development. To keep a consistent ID, follow these steps:

### Upload extension to the developer dashboard

Package the extension directory into a `.zip` file and upload it to the [Chrome Developer
Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard) without publishing it:

1. On the Developer Dashboard, click **Add new item**.
2. Click **Browse files**, select the extension's zip file, and upload it.
3. Go to the **Package** tab and click **View public key**.

When the popup is open, follow these steps:

1. Copy the code in between `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`.
2. Remove the newlines in order to make it a single line of text.

Add the code to the `manifest.json` under the [`"key"`](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/key) field.
This way the extension will use the same ID.

```
{ // manifest.json
  "manifest_version": 3,
...
  "key": "ThisKeyIsGoingToBeVeryLong/go8GGC2u3UD9WI3MkmBgyiDPP2OreImEQhPvwpliioUMJmERZK3zPAx72z8MDvGp7Fx7ZlzuZpL4yyp4zXBI+MUhFGoqEh32oYnm4qkS4JpjWva5Ktn4YpAWxd4pSCVs8I4MZms20+yx5OlnlmWQEwQiiIwPPwG1e1jRw0Ak5duPpE3uysVGZXkGhC5FyOFM+oVXwc1kMqrrKnQiMJ3lgh59LjkX4z1cDNX3MomyUMJ+I+DaWC2VdHggB74BNANSd+zkPQeNKg3o7FetlDJya1bk8ofdNBARxHFMBtMXu/ONfCT3Q2kCY9gZDRktmNRiHG/1cXhkIcN1RWrbsCkwIDAQAB",
}

```
### Compare IDs

Open the Extensions Management page at `chrome://extensions`, ensure **Developer mode** is enabled,
and upload the unpackaged extension directory. Compare the extension ID on the extensions management
page to the Item ID in the Developer Dashboard. They should match.

# Manifest - Minimum Chrome Version

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

An optional manifest key containing a string that defines which versions of
Chrome are able to install the extension. The value set for this string must be
a substring of an existing Chrome browser version string. Use a full version
number to specify a specific update to Chrome, or use the first number in the
string to specify a particular major version.

```

}

```
## Enforcement

### New Installs

In versions of Chrome older than the minimum version, the Chrome Web Store will
show a "Not compatible" message in place of the install button. Users on these
versions won't be able to install your extension.

### Existing Installs

Existing users of your extension won't receive updates when the
`minimum_chrome_version` is higher than their current browser version. This
happens silently so you should exercise caution and consider ways of letting
existing users know that they are no longer receiving updates.

# Manifest - oauth2

An optional manifest key enabling the use of an OAuth 2.0 security ID on the extension. This key takes an object with two required sub-properties: `"client_id"` and `"scopes"`. When developing an extension that uses an `"oauth2"` key, consider also setting the extension's [`"key"`](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/key) to keep a [consistent extension ID](/docs/extensions/mv3/tut_oauth#keep-consistent-id).

For more detailed implementation instructions, visit the full [OAuth 2.0 tutorial](/docs/extensions/mv3/tut_oauth).

```
{
  // ...
     "oauth2": {
      "client_id": "YOUR_EXTENSION_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
      "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly"]

# Manifest - Requirements

Stay organized with collections

Technologies required by the extension. Hosting sites such as the Chrome Web Store may use this list
to dissuade users from installing extensions that will not work on their computer. Additional requirements checks may be added in
the future.

The `"3D"` requirement denotes GPU hardware acceleration and takes either `"webgl"` or `"css3d"` as valid values. The `"webgl"` requirement refers to the [WebGL
API](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/). For more information on Chrome 3D graphics support, see the help article on [WebGL and 3D
graphics](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1220892). You can list the 3D-related features your extension requires, as demonstrated in the
following example:

```
"requirements": {
  "3D": {
    "features": ["webgl"]
  }
}

```

NPAPI Plugin support for extensions has been [discontinued](https://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html) as of Chrome version 45. As part of this, the **"plugins"**
requirement has been deprecated, and can no longer be used in a manifest file.

# Manifest - Sandbox  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/sandbox

# Manifest - Sandbox

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Defines a collection of extension pages that are to be served in a sandboxed unique origin. The
Content Security Policy used by an extension's sandboxed pages is specified in the
[`"content_security_policy"`](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/content_security_policy) key.

Being in a sandbox has two implications:

1. A sandboxed page won't have access to extension APIs, or direct access to
   non-sandboxed pages (it may communicate with them using `postMessage()`).
2. A sandboxed page is not subject to the Content Security Policy (CSP) used by the rest of
   the extension (it has its own separate CSP value). This means that, for example, it can
   use inline script and `eval()`.

For example, here's how to specify that two extension pages are to be served in a sandbox with a
custom CSP:

```
{
  ...
  "content_security_policy": {
    "sandbox": "sandbox allow-scripts; script-src 'self' https://example.com"
  },
  "sandbox": {
    "pages": [
      "page1.html",
      "directory/page2.html"
    ]
  },
  ...
}

```

If not specified, the default `"content_security_policy"` value is `sandbox allow-scripts allow-forms
allow-popups allow-modals; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; child-src 'self';`.

You can specify your CSP value to restrict the sandbox even further, but it MUST include the
`"sandbox"` directive and MUST NOT have the `allow-same-origin` token (see [the HTML5
specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#attr-iframe-sandbox) for possible sandbox tokens).

Note that you only need to list pages that you expect to be loaded in windows or frames. Resources
used by sandboxed pages (e.g. stylesheets or JavaScript source files) don't need to appear in the
`pages` list because they will use the sandbox of the frame that embeds them.

["Using eval() in Chrome Extensions"](/docs/extensions/how-to/security/sandboxing-eval) goes into more detail about implementing a
sandboxing workflow that enables the use of libraries that would otherwise have issues executing under
extension's [default Content Security Policy](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/content_security_policy).

# Shared modules  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/shared-modules

# Shared modules

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Shared Modules* are permissionless collections of resources that can be shared between
extensions. Common uses of Shared Modules are:

* As an API. You can distribute a Shared Module that can provide HTML, JS, and other resources to
  provide an API that can be updated independently of the extensions that depend on it.
* As a download optimization. The Shared Module contains common resources used by many extensions.
  It's downloaded once, the first time a dependent extension is installed.

## Manifest

Shared Modules are used through two [manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) fields: `"export"` and `"import"`.

### Export

The *export* field indicates an extension is a Shared Module that exports its resources:

```
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "My Shared Module",
  "export": {
    // Optional list of extension IDs explicitly allowed to
    // import this Shared Module's resources.  If no allowlist
    // is given, all extensions are allowed to import it.
    "allowlist": [
      "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
    ]
  }
  // Note: no permissions are allowed in Shared Modules
}

```
### Import

The *import* field is used by extensions and apps to declare that they depend on the resources from
particular Shared Modules:

```
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "My Importing Extension",
  ...
  "import": [
    {"id": "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc"},
    {"id": "dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"
     "minimum_version": "0.5" // optional
    },
  ]
}

```
## Accessing resources

Shared Module resources are accessed by a reserved path *\_modules/SHARED\_MODULE\_ID* in the root
of your importing extension. For example, to include the script `foo.js` from a Shared Module with
ID "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc", use this path from the root of your extension:

```
<script src="_modules/cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc/foo.js">

```

If the importing extension has ID "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", then the full URL to resources
in the Shared Module is:

```
chrome-extension://aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/_modules/cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc/

```

Note that since resources from Shared Modules are overlaid into the origin of the importing
extension, all privileges granted to the importing extension are available to code in Shared
Modules. Also, the Shared Module can access resources in the importing extension by using
absolute paths.

## Install / uninstall

A Shared Module is automatically installed from the Chrome Web Store when needed by a dependent extension and automatically uninstalled when the last extension which references it is uninstalled.
To upload an extension that uses a Shared Module, the Shared Module must be published in
the Chrome Web Store and the extension must not be restricted from using the Shared Module by its
allowlist.

During development, you will need to manually install any Shared Modules your extension uses.
Automatic installs do not happen for extensions that are side-loaded or loaded as unpacked
extensions. For locally installed, unpacked Shared Modules, you must use the [key](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/key) field to
ensure the Shared Modules use the correct IDs.

# Manifest for managed storage  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/storage

# Manifest for managed storage

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Unlike the `local` and `sync` storage areas, the `managed` storage area requires its structure to be
declared as [JSON Schema](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03) and is strictly validated by Chrome. This schema must be stored in a
file indicated by the `"managed_schema"` property of the `"storage"` manifest key and declares the
enterprise policies supported by the extension.

Policies are analogous to options but are
[configured by a system administrator](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/)
for policy installed extensions, allowing the extension to be preconfigured for
all users of an organization. See [how Chrome handles policies](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/) for examples
from Chrome itself.

After declaring the policies they can be read from the [storage.managed](/docs/extensions/reference/storage#property-managed) API. It's up to the
extension to enforce the policies configured by the administrator.

## Sample manifest.json

The `storage.managed_schema` property indicates a file within the extension that contains the policy
schema.

```
{
  "name": "My enterprise extension",
  "storage": {
    "managed_schema": "schema.json"
  },
  ...
}

```

Chrome will then load these policies from the underlying operating system and from Google Apps for
signed-in users. The [`storage.onChanged`](/docs/extensions/reference/storage#event-onChanged) event is fired whenever a policy change is detected.
You can verify the policies that Chrome loaded at chrome://policy.

## Schema format

The JSON Schema format has some additional requirements from Chrome:

* The top-level schema must have type `object`.
* The top-level `object` can't have `additionalProperties`. The `properties` declared are the
  policies for this extension.
* Each schema must have either a `$ref` value or exactly one `type`.

If the schema is invalid then Chrome won't load the extension and will indicate the reason why the
schema wasn't validated. If a policy value does not conform to the schema then it won't be
published by the `storage.managed` API.

## Sample schema

```
{
  "type": "object",

  // "properties" maps an optional key of this object to its schema. At the
  // top-level object, these keys are the policy names supported.
  "properties": {

    // The policy name "AutoSave" is mapped to its schema, which in this case
    // declares it as a simple boolean value.
    // "title" and "description" are optional and are used to show a
    // user-friendly name and documentation to the administrator.
    "AutoSave": {
      "title": "Automatically save changes.",
      "description": "If set to true then changes will be automatically saved.",
      "type": "boolean"
    },

    // Other simple types supported include "integer", "string" and "number".
    "PollRefreshRate": {
      "type": "integer"
    },

    "DefaultServiceUrl": {
      "type": "string"
    },

    // "array" is a list of items that conform to another schema, described
    // in "items". An example to this schema is [ "one", "two" ].
    "ServiceUrls": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },

    // A more complex example that describes a list of bookmarks. Each bookmark
    // has a "title", and can have a "url" or a list of "children" bookmarks.
    // The "id" attribute is used to name a schema, and other schemas can reuse
    // it using the "$ref" attribute.
    "Bookmarks": {
      "type": "array",
      "id": "ListOfBookmarks",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "title": { "type": "string" },
          "url": { "type": "string" },
          "children": { "$ref": "ListOfBookmarks" }
        }
      }
    },

    // An "object" can have known properties listed as "properties", and can
    // optionally have "additionalProperties" indicating a schema to apply to
    // keys that aren't found in "properties".
    // This example policy could map a URL to its settings. An example value:
    // {
    //   "youtube.com": {
    //     "blocklisted": true
    //   },
    //   "google.com": {
    //     "bypass_proxy": true
    //   }
    // }
    "SettingsForUrls": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "blocklisted": { "type": "boolean" },
          "bypass_proxy": { "type": "boolean" }

# Manifest - Version  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/version

# Manifest - Version

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

One to four dot-separated integers identifying the version of this extension. A couple of rules
apply to the integers:

* The integers must be between 0 and 65535, inclusive.
* Non-zero integers can't start with 0. For example, 032 is invalid because it begins with a zero.
* They must not be all zero. For example, 0 and 0.0.0.0 are invalid while 0.1.0.0 is valid.

Here are some examples of valid versions:

* `"version": "1"`
* `"version": "1.0"`
* `"version": "2.10.2"`
* `"version": "3.1.2.4567"`

If the published extension has a newer version string than the installed extension, then
the extension is automatically updated.

The comparison starts with the leftmost integers. Then, if those integers are equal, the integers to
the right are compared, and so on. For example, 1.2.0 is a newer version than 1.1.9.9999.

A missing integer is equal to zero. For example, 1.1.9.9999 is newer than 1.1, and 1.1.9.9999 is
older than 1.2.

## Version name

In addition to the `"version"` field, which is used for update purposes, `"version_name"` can be set to a
descriptive version string and will be used for display purposes if present.

Here are some examples of version names:

* `"version_name": "1.0 beta"`
* `"version_name": "build rc2"`
* `"version_name": "3.1.2.4567"`

If no version\_name is present, the version field will be used for display purposes as well.

# Manifest - Web Accessible Resources  |  Chrome Extensions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/web-accessible-resources

# Manifest - Web Accessible Resources

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

Web-accessible resources are files inside an extension that can be accessed by web pages or other
extensions. Extensions typically use this feature to expose images or other assets that need to be
loaded in web pages, but any asset included in an extension's bundle can be made web accessible.

By default no resources are web accessible, as this allows a malicious website to [fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) extensions that a user has installed
or exploit vulnerabilities (for example [XSS bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)) in installed extensions. Only pages or scripts loaded from an extension's origin
can access that extension's resources.

## Manifest declaration

Use the `web_accessible_resources` manifest property to declare which resources are exposed and to
what origins. This property is an array of objects that declares resource access rules. Each object
maps an array of extension resources to an array of URLs and/or extension IDs that can access those resources.

```
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [ "test1.png", "test2.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://web-accessible-resources-1.glitch.me/*" ]
    }, {
      "resources": [ "test3.png", "test4.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://web-accessible-resources-2.glitch.me/*" ],
      "use_dynamic_url": true
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

Each object in the array contains these elements:

`"resources"`
An array of strings, each containing a relative path to a given resource from the extension's root directory. Resources may contain asterisks (`*`) for wildcard matches. For example, `"/images/*"` exposes everything in the extension's `images/` directory, recursively, while `"*.png"` exposes all PNG files.
`"matches"`
An array of strings, each containing a [match pattern](/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns) that specifies which sites can access this set of resources. Only the origin is used to match URLs. Origins include subdomain matching. Google Chrome emits an "Invalid match pattern" error if the pattern has a path other than '/\*'.
`"extension_ids"`
An array of strings, each containing the ID of an extension that can access the resources.
`"use_dynamic_url"`
If true, only allow resources to be accessed through a dynamic ID. A dynamic ID is generated per session. That means it is regenerated when the browser restarts or the extension reloads.

Each element must include a `"resources"` element and either a `"matches"` or `"extension_ids"` element. This establishes a mapping that exposes the specified resources to either web pages matching the pattern or to extensions with matching IDs. The `"use_dynamic_url"` element is optional.

## Navigability of resources

Resources are available in a webpage via the URL
`chrome-extension://[PACKAGE ID]/[PATH]`, which can be generated with the [`runtime.getURL()`](/docs/extensions/reference/extension#method-getURL)
method. The resources are served with appropriate [CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) headers, so they're available
via `fetch()`.

A navigation from a web origin to an extension resource is blocked unless the resource is
listed as web accessible. Note these corner cases:

* When an extension uses the [webRequest](/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest) API to redirect a public
  resource request to a resource that is not web accessible, such a request is also blocked.
* The above holds true even if the resource that is not web accessible is owned by the redirecting
  extension.
* Navigation is blocked in incognito mode unless the value of the [`"incognito"` field](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/incognito) is set to `"split"`.

[Content scripts](/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts) themselves do not need to be allowed.

## Example

The [Web Accessible Resources example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/web-accessible-resources) demonstrates the use of this element in a working extension.

# chrome.pageAction

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.pageAction` API to put icons in the main Google Chrome toolbar, to the right of the address bar. Page actions represent actions that can be taken on the current page, but that aren't applicable to all pages. Page actions appear grayed out when inactive.

## Availability

&leq; MV2

Some examples:

* Subscribe to this page's RSS feed
* Make a slideshow out of this page's photos

The RSS icon in the following screenshot represents a page action that lets you subscribe to the RSS
feed for the current page.

Hidden page actions appear grayed out. For example, the RSS feed below is grayed out, as you can't
subscribe to the feed for the current page:

Please consider using a [browser action](/docs/extensions/mv2/reference/browserAction) instead, so that users can always interact with your
extension.

## Manifest

Register your page action in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) like this:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "page_action": {
    "default_icon": {                    // optional
      "16": "images/icon16.png",           // optional
      "24": "images/icon24.png",           // optional
      "32": "images/icon32.png"            // optional
    },
    "default_title": "Google Mail",      // optional; shown in tooltip
    "default_popup": "popup.html"        // optional
  },
  ...
}

```

Since devices with less-common scale factors like 1.5x or 1.2x are becoming more common, you are
encouraged to provide multiple sizes for your icons. Chrome will select the closest one and scale it
to fill the 16-dip space. This also ensures that if the icon display size is ever changed, you don't
need to do any more work to provide different icons! However, if the size difference is too extreme,
this scaling can cause the icon to lose detail or look fuzzy.

The old syntax for registering the default icon is still supported:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "page_action": {
    ...
    "default_icon": "images/icon32.png"  // optional
    // equivalent to "default_icon": { "32": "images/icon32.png" }
  },
  ...
}

```
## Parts of the UI

Like browser actions, page actions can have an icon, a tooltip, and popup; they can't have badges,
however. In addition, page actions can be grayed out. You can find information about icons,
tooltips, and popups by reading about the [browser action UI](/docs/extensions/mv2/reference/browserAction#ui).

You make a page action appear and be grayed out using the [`pageAction.show`](#method-show) and
[`pageAction.hide`](#method-hide) methods, respectively. By default, a page action appears grayed out. When you
show it, you specify the tab in which the icon should appear. The icon remains visible until the tab
is closed or starts displaying a different URL (because the user clicks a link, for example).

## Tips

For the best visual impact, follow these guidelines:

* **Do** use page actions for features that make sense for only a few pages.
* **Don't** use page actions for features that make sense for most pages. Use [browser actions](/docs/extensions/mv2/reference/browserAction)
  instead.
* **Don't** constantly animate your icon. That's just annoying.

# chrome.permissions  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/permissions

# chrome.permissions

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.permissions` API to request [declared optional permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) at run time rather than install time, so users understand why the permissions are needed and grant only those that are necessary.

## Concepts and usage

Permission warnings exist to describe the capabilities granted by an API, but some of these warnings may not be obvious. The Permissions API allows developers to explain permission warnings and introduce new features gradually which gives users a risk-free introduction to the extension. This way, users can specify how much access they are willing to grant and which features they want to enable.

For example, the [optional permissions extension's](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/sample.optional_permissions) core functionality is overriding the new tab page. One feature is displaying the user's goal of the day. This feature only requires the [storage](/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage) permission, which does not include a warning. The extension has an additional feature, that users can enable by clicking the following button:

Displaying the user's top sites requires the [topSites](/docs/extensions/reference/api/topSites) permission, which has the following warning.

### Implement optional permissions

#### Step 1: Decide which permissions are required and which are optional

An extension can declare both required and optional permissions. In general, you should:

* Use required permissions when they are needed for your extension's basic functionality.
* Use optional permissions when they are needed for optional features in your extension.

Advantages of *required* permissions:

* **Fewer prompts:** An extension can prompt the user once to accept all permissions.
* **Simpler development:** Required permissions are guaranteed to be present.

Advantages of *optional* permissions:

* **Better security:** Extensions run with fewer permissions since users only enable permissions
  that are needed.
* **Better information for users:** An extension can explain why it needs a particular permission
  when the user enables the relevant feature.
* **Easier upgrades:** When you upgrade your extension, Chrome won't disable it for your users if
  the upgrade adds optional rather than required permissions.

#### Step 2: Declare optional permissions in the manifest

Declare optional permissions in your [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) with the `optional_permissions` key,
using the same format as the [permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) field:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "optional_permissions": ["tabs"],
  "optional_host_permissions": ["https://www.google.com/"],
  ...
}

```

If you want to request hosts that you only discover at runtime, include `"https://*/*"` in your extension's `optional_host_permissions` field. This lets you specify any origin in [`"Permissions.origins"`](#property-Permissions-origins) as long as it has a matching
scheme.

**Permissions that can *not* be specified as optional**

Most Chrome extension permissions can be specified as optional, with the following exceptions.

| Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"debugger"` | The [chrome.debugger](/docs/extensions/reference/api/debugger) API serves as an alternate transport for Chrome's [remote debugging protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/). |
| `"declarativeNetRequest"` | Grants the extension access to the [chrome.declarativeNetRequest](/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest) API. |
| `"devtools"` | Allows extension to expand [Chrome DevTools](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) functionality. |
| `"geolocation"` | Allows the extension to use the HTML5 [geolocation](https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/) API. |
| `"mdns"` | Grants the extension access to the [chrome.mdns](/docs/apps/reference/mdns) API. |
| `"proxy"` | Grants the extension access to the [chrome.proxy](/docs/extensions/reference/api/proxy) API to manage Chrome's proxy settings. |
| `"tts"` | The [chrome.tts](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts) API plays synthesized text-to-speech (TTS). |
| `"ttsEngine"` | The [chrome.ttsEngine](/docs/extensions/reference/api/ttsEngine) API implements a text-to-speech (TTS) engine using an extension. |
| `"wallpaper"` | **ChromeOS only**. Use the [chrome.wallpaper](/docs/extensions/reference/api/wallpaper) API change the ChromeOS wallpaper. |

View [Declare Permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) for further information on available permissions and
their warnings.

#### Step 3: Request optional permissions

Request the permissions from within a user gesture using `permissions.request()`:

```
document.querySelector('#my-button').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // Permissions must be requested from inside a user gesture, like a button's
  // click handler.
  chrome.permissions.request({
    permissions: ['tabs'],
    origins: ['https://www.google.com/']
  }, (granted) => {
    // The callback argument will be true if the user granted the permissions.
    if (granted) {
      doSomething();
    } else {
      doSomethingElse();
    }
  });
});

```

Chrome prompts the user if adding the permissions results in different [warning messages](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) than
the user has already seen and accepted. For example, the previous code might result in a prompt like
this:

#### Step 4: Check the extension's current permissions

To check whether your extension has a specific permission or set of permissions, use
`permission.contains()`:

```
chrome.permissions.contains({
  permissions: ['tabs'],
  origins: ['https://www.google.com/']
}, (result) => {
  if (result) {
    // The extension has the permissions.
  } else {
    // The extension doesn't have the permissions.
  }
});

```
#### Step 5: Remove the permissions

You should remove permissions when you no longer need them. After a permission has been removed,
calling `permissions.request()` usually adds the permission back without prompting the user.

```
chrome.permissions.remove({
  permissions: ['tabs'],
  origins: ['https://www.google.com/']
}, (removed) => {
  if (removed) {
    // The permissions have been removed.
  } else {
    // The permissions have not been removed (e.g., you tried to remove
    // required permissions).
  }
});

```
## Types

### Permissions

#### Properties

* origins

  string[] optional

  The list of host permissions, including those specified in the `optional_permissions` or `permissions` keys in the manifest, and those associated with [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts).
* permissions

  string[] optional

  List of named permissions (does not include hosts or origins).
## Methods

### addHostAccessRequest()

Promise
PendingMV3+

```
chrome.permissions.addHostAccessRequest(  
  request: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Adds a host access request. Request will only be signaled to the user if extension can be granted access to the host in the request. Request will be reset on cross-origin navigation. When accepted, grants persistent access to the site’s top origin

#### Parameters

* request

  object

  + documentId

    string optional

    The id of a document where host access requests can be shown. Must be the top-level document within a tab. If provided, the request is shown on the tab of the specified document and is removed when the document navigates to a new origin. Adding a new request will override any existent request for `tabId`. This or `tabId` must be specified.
  + pattern

    string optional

    The URL pattern where host access requests can be shown. If provided, host access requests will only be shown on URLs that match this pattern.
  + tabId

    number optional

    The id of the tab where host access requests can be shown. If provided, the request is shown on the specified tab and is removed when the tab navigates to a new origin. Adding a new request will override an existent request for `documentId`. This or `documentId` must be specified.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### contains()

Promise

```
chrome.permissions.contains(  
  permissions: [Permissions](#type-Permissions),  
  callback?: function,

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: boolean) => void
  ```

  + result

    boolean

    True if the extension has the specified permissions. If an origin is specified as both an optional permission and a content script match pattern, this will return `false` unless both permissions are granted.
#### Returns

* Promise<boolean>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

    The extension's active permissions. Note that the `origins` property will contain granted origins from those specified in the `permissions` and `optional_permissions` keys in the manifest and those associated with [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts).
#### Returns

* Promise<[Permissions](#type-Permissions)>

  Chrome 96+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### remove()

Promise

```
chrome.permissions.remove(  
  permissions: [Permissions](#type-Permissions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Removes access to the specified permissions. If there are any problems removing the permissions, [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime/#property-lastError) will be set.

#### Parameters

* permissions

  [Permissions](#type-Permissions)
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (removed: boolean) => void
  ```

  + removed

    boolean

    True if the permissions were removed.

  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### request()

Promise

```
chrome.permissions.request(  
  permissions: [Permissions](#type-Permissions),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Requests access to the specified permissions, displaying a prompt to the user if necessary. These permissions must either be defined in the `optional_permissions` field of the manifest or be required permissions that were withheld by the user. Paths on origin patterns will be ignored. You can request subsets of optional origin permissions; for example, if you specify `*://*\/*` in the `optional_permissions` section of the manifest, you can request `http://example.com/`. If there are any problems requesting the permissions, [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime/#property-lastError) will be set.

# Permissions  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/permissions-list

# Permissions

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

To access most extension APIs and features, you must declare permissions in your
extension's [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). Some permissions
trigger warnings that users must allow to continue using the extension.

# chrome.printing  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/printing/

# chrome.printing

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.printing` API to send print jobs to printers installed on Chromebook.

## Permissions

`printing`  
## Availability

Chrome 81+
ChromeOS only

All `chrome.printing` methods and events require you to declare the `"printing"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "printing"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Examples

The examples below demonstrate using each of the methods in the printing namespace. This code is copied from or based on the [api-samples/printing](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/printing) in the extensions-samples Github repo.

### cancelJob()

This example uses the `onJobStatusChanged` handler to hide a 'cancel' button when the `jobStatus` is neither `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`. Note that on some networks or when a Chromebook is connected directly to the printer, these states may pass too quickly for the cancel button to be visible long enough to be called. This is greatly simplified printing example.

```
chrome.printing.onJobStatusChanged.addListener((jobId, status) => {
  const cancelButton = document.getElementById("cancelButton");
  cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    chrome.printing.cancelJob(jobId).then((response) => {
      if (response !== undefined) {
        console.log(response.status);
      }
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
        console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
      }
    });
  });
  if (status !== "PENDING" && status !== "IN_PROGRESS") {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'hidden';
  } else {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'visible';
  }
}

```
### getPrinters() and getPrinterInfo()

A single example is used for these functions because getting printer information requires a printer ID, which is retrieved by calling `getPrinters()`. This example logs the name and description of the default printer to the console. This is a simplified version of the printing example.

```
​​const printers = await chrome.printing.getPrinters();
const defaultPrinter = printers.find((printer) => {
  const printerInfo = await chrome.printing.getPrinterInfo(printer.id);
  return printerInfo.isDefault;
}
console.log(`Default printer: ${defaultPrinter.name}.\n\t${defaultPrinter.description}`);

```
### submitJob()

The `submitJob()` method requires three things.

* A `ticket` structure specifying which capabilities of the printer are to be used. If the user needs to select from available capabilities, you can retrieve them for a specific printer using `getPrinterInfo()`.
* A `SubmitJobRequest` structure, which specifies the printer to use, and the file or date to print. This structure contains a reference to the `ticket` structure.
* A blob of the file or data to print.

Calling `submitJob()` triggers a dialog box asking the user to confirm printing. Use the [`PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist`](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist%22) to bypass confirmation.

This is a simplified version of the printing example. Notice that the `ticket` is attached to the `SubmitJobRequest` structure (line 8) and that the data to print is converted to a blob (line 10). Getting the ID of the printer (line 1) is more complicated [in the sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/printing) than is shown here.

```
const defaultPrinter = getDefaultPrinter();
const ticket = getPrinterTicket(defaultPrinter);
const arrayBuffer = getPrintData();
const submitJobRequest = {
  job: {
    printerId: defaultPrinter,
    title: 'test job',
    ticket: ticket,
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    document: new Blob([new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)], {
      type: 'application/pdf'
    });
  }
};

chrome.printing.submitJob(submitJobRequest, (response) => {
  if (response !== undefined) {
    console.log(response.status);
  }
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
    console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  }
});

```
### Roll printing

This example shows how to build a printer ticket for continuous (or roll) printing, which is often used with receipt printing. The `submitJobRequest` object for roll printing is the same as that shown for the [`submitJob()`](#submitjob) example.

If you need to change the default value for paper cutting, use the `vendor_ticket_item` key. (The default varies from printer to printer.) To change the value, provide an array with one member: an object whose `id` is `'finishings'`. The value can either be `'trim'` for printers that cut the roll at the end of printing or `'none'` for printers that require the print job to be torn off.

```
const ticket = {
  version: '1.0',
  print: {
    vendor_ticket_item: [{id: 'finishings', value: 'trim'}],
    color: {type: 'STANDARD_MONOCHROME'},
    duplex: {type: 'NO_DUPLEX'},
    page_orientation: {type: 'PORTRAIT'},
    copies: {copies: 1},
    dpi: {horizontal_dpi: 300, vertical_dpi: 300},
    media_size: {
      width_microns: 72320,
      height_microns: 100000
    },
    collate: {collate: false}
  }
};

```

Some printers do not support the `"finishings"` option. To determine if your printer does, call [`getPrinterInfo()`](#method-getPrinterInfo) and look for a `"display_name"` of `"finishings/11"`.

```
"vendor_capability": [
  {
    "display_name": "finishings/11",
    "id": "finishings/11",
    "type": "TYPED_VALUE",
    "typed_value_cap": {
      "value_type": "BOOLEAN"
    }
  },
  ...
]

```

The values in a ticket's `media_size` key are specific to each printer. To select an appropriate size call [`getPrinterInfo()`](#method-getPrinterInfo). The returned [`GetPrinterResponse`](#type-GetPrinterInfoResponse) contains an array of supported media sizes at `"media_size"."option"`. Choose an option whose `"is_continuous_feed"` value is true. Use its height and width values for the ticket.

```
"media_size": {
  "option": [
  {
    "custom_display_name": "",
    "is_continuous_feed": true,
    "max_height_microns": 2000000,
    "min_height_microns": 25400,
    "width_microns": 50800
  },
  ...
  ]
}

```

# chrome.runtime  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime

# chrome.runtime

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.runtime` API to retrieve the service worker, return details about the manifest, and listen for and respond to events in the extension lifecycle. You can also use this API to convert the relative path of URLs to fully-qualified URLs.

Most members of this API do **not** require any permissions. This permission is needed for [`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative), [`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage) and [`onNativeConnect`](#event-onConnectNative).

The following example shows how to declare the `"nativeMessaging"` permission in the manifest:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "nativeMessaging"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

The Runtime API provides methods to support a number of areas that your extensions
can use:

Message passing
Your extension can communicate with different contexts within your extension and also with other extensions using these methods and events:
[`connect()`](#method-connect),
[`onConnect`](#event-onConnect),
[`onConnectExternal`](#event-onConnectExternal),
[`sendMessage()`](#method-sendMessage),
[`onMessage`](#event-onMessage) and
[`onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal).
In addition, your extension can pass messages to native applications on the user's device using
[`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative) and
[`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage).

Accessing extension and platform metadata
These methods let you retrieve several specific pieces of metadata about the extension and the
platform. Methods in this category include
[`getManifest()`](#method-getManifest), and
[`getPlatformInfo()`](#method-getPlatformInfo).
Managing extension lifecycle and options
These properties let you perform some meta-operations on the extension, and display the options page.
Methods and events in this category include
[`onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled),
[`onStartup`](#event-onStartup),
[`openOptionsPage()`](#method-openOptionsPage),
[`reload()`](#method-reload),
[`requestUpdateCheck()`](#method-requestUpdateCheck), and
[`setUninstallURL()`](#method-setUninstallURL).
Helper utilities
These methods provide utility such as the conversion of internal resource representations to
external formats. Methods in this category include
[`getURL()`](#method-getURL).
Kiosk mode utilities
These methods are available only on ChromeOS, and exist mainly to support kiosk implementations.
Methods in this category include
[`restart()`](#method-restart) and
[`restartAfterDelay()``](#method-restartAfterDelay).
### Unpacked extension behavior

When an [unpacked](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) extension is [reloaded](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#reload), this is treated as an update. This means that the
[`chrome.runtime.onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled) event will fire with the `"update"` reason. This
includes when the extension is reloaded with [`chrome.runtime.reload()`](#method-reload).

## Use cases

### Add an image to a web page

For a web page to access an asset hosted on another domain, it must specify the resource's full URL
(e.g. `<img src="https://example.com/logo.png">`). The same is true to include an extension asset on
a web page. The two differences are that the extension's assets must be exposed as [web
accessible resources](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) and that typically content scripts are responsible for injecting
extension assets.

In this example, the extension will add `logo.png` to the page that the [content
script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts) is being [injected](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality) into by using `runtime.getURL()` to create a
fully-qualified URL. But first, the asset must be declared as a web accessible resource in the manifest.

manifest.json:

```
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [ "logo.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://*/*" ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

content.js:

```
{ // Block used to avoid setting global variables
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = chrome.runtime.getURL('logo.png');
  document.body.append(img);
}

```
### Send data from a content script to the service worker

Its common for an extension's content scripts to need data managed by another part of the extension,
like the service worker. Much like two browser windows opened to the same web page, these
two contexts cannot directly access each other's values. Instead, the extension can use [message
passing](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging) to coordinate across these different contexts.

In this example, the content script needs some data from the extension's service worker to
initialize its UI. To get this data, it passes the developer-defined `get-user-data` message
to the service worker, and it responds with a copy of the user's information.

content.js:

```
// 1. Send a message to the service worker requesting the user's data
chrome.runtime.sendMessage('get-user-data', (response) => {
  // 3. Got an asynchronous response with the data from the service worker
  console.log('received user data', response);
  initializeUI(response);
});

```

service-worker.js:

```
// Example of a simple user data object
const user = {
  username: 'demo-user'
};

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  // 2. A page requested user data, respond with a copy of `user`
  if (message === 'get-user-data') {
    sendResponse(user);
  }
});

```
### Gather feedback on uninstall

Many extensions use post-uninstall surveys to understand how the extension could better serve its
users and improve retention. The following example shows how to add this functionality.

background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(details => {
  if (details.reason === chrome.runtime.OnInstalledReason.INSTALL) {
    chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL('https://example.com/extension-survey');
  }
});

```
## Examples

See the [Manifest V3 - Web Accessible Resources demo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/web-accessible-resources) for more Runtime API examples.

  Details about the error which occurred.
## Methods

### connect()

```
chrome.runtime.connect(  
  extensionId?: string,  
  connectInfo?: object,  
)
```

Attempts to connect listeners within an extension (such as the background page), or other extensions/apps. This is useful for content scripts connecting to their extension processes, inter-app/extension communication, and [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable). Note that this does not connect to any listeners in a content script. Extensions may connect to content scripts embedded in tabs via [`tabs.connect`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-connect).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to connect to. If omitted, a connection will be attempted with your own extension. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/externally-connectable).
* connectInfo

  object optional

  + includeTlsChannelId

    boolean optional

    Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onConnectExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.
  + name

    string optional

    Will be passed into onConnect for processes that are listening for the connection event.
#### Returns

* [Port](#type-Port)

  Port through which messages can be sent and received. The port's [onDisconnect](#type-Port) event is fired if the extension does not exist.
### connectNative()

```
chrome.runtime.connectNative(  
  application: string,  
)
```

Connects to a native application in the host machine. This method requires the `"nativeMessaging"` permission. See [Native Messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) for more information.

#### Parameters

* application

  string

  The name of the registered application to connect to.
#### Returns

* [Port](#type-Port)

  Port through which messages can be sent and received with the application
### getBackgroundPage()

Promise
Foreground only
Deprecated
```
chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Background pages do not exist in MV3 extensions.

Retrieves the JavaScript 'window' object for the background page running inside the current extension/app. If the background page is an event page, the system will ensure it is loaded before calling the callback. If there is no background page, an error is set.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (backgroundPage?: Window) => void
  ```

  + backgroundPage

    Window optional

    The JavaScript 'window' object for the background page.
#### Returns

* Promise<Window | undefined>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getContexts()

Chrome 116+
MV3+

```
chrome.runtime.getContexts(  
  filter: [ContextFilter](#type-ContextFilter),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Fetches information about active contexts associated with this extension

#### Parameters

* filter

  [ContextFilter](#type-ContextFilter)

  A filter to find matching contexts. A context matches if it matches all specified fields in the filter. Any unspecified field in the filter matches all contexts.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (contexts: [ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]) => void
  ```

  + contexts

    [ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]

    The matching contexts, if any.
#### Returns

* Promise<[ExtensionContext](#type-ExtensionContext)[]>

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getManifest()

```
chrome.runtime.getPackageDirectoryEntry(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Returns a DirectoryEntry for the package directory.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (platformInfo: [PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)) => void
  ```

  + platformInfo

    [PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)
#### Returns

* Promise<[PlatformInfo](#type-PlatformInfo)>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getURL()

```
chrome.runtime.getURL(  
  path: string,  
)
```

Converts a relative path within an app/extension install directory to a fully-qualified URL.

#### Parameters

* path

  string

  A path to a resource within an app/extension expressed relative to its install directory.
#### Returns

* string

  The fully-qualified URL to the resource.
### openOptionsPage()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Open your Extension's options page, if possible.

The precise behavior may depend on your manifest's [`options_ui`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#embedded_options) or [`options_page`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#full_page) key, or what Chrome happens to support at the time. For example, the page may be opened in a new tab, within chrome://extensions, within an App, or it may just focus an open options page. It will never cause the caller page to reload.

If your Extension does not declare an options page, or Chrome failed to create one for some other reason, the callback will set [`lastError`](#property-lastError).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 99+

  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### reload()

```
chrome.runtime.reload()
```

Reloads the app or extension. This method is not supported in kiosk mode. For kiosk mode, use chrome.runtime.restart() method.

### requestUpdateCheck()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.requestUpdateCheck(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Requests an immediate update check be done for this app/extension.

**Important**: Most extensions/apps should **not** use this method, since Chrome already does automatic checks every few hours, and you can listen for the [`runtime.onUpdateAvailable`](#event-onUpdateAvailable) event without needing to call requestUpdateCheck.

This method is only appropriate to call in very limited circumstances, such as if your extension talks to a backend service, and the backend service has determined that the client extension version is very far out of date and you'd like to prompt a user to update. Most other uses of requestUpdateCheck, such as calling it unconditionally based on a repeating timer, probably only serve to waste client, network, and server resources.

Note: When called with a callback, instead of returning an object this function will return the two properties as separate arguments passed to the callback.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: object) => void
  ```

  + result

    object

    Chrome 109+

    RequestUpdateCheckResult object that holds the status of the update check and any details of the result if there is an update available

    - status

      [RequestUpdateCheckStatus](#type-RequestUpdateCheckStatus)

      Result of the update check.
    - version

      string optional

      If an update is available, this contains the version of the available update.
#### Returns

* Promise<object>

  Chrome 109+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### restart()

```
chrome.runtime.restart()
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode. Otherwise, it's no-op.

### restartAfterDelay()

Promise
Chrome 53+

```
chrome.runtime.restartAfterDelay(  
  seconds: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode after the given seconds. If called again before the time ends, the reboot will be delayed. If called with a value of -1, the reboot will be cancelled. It's a no-op in non-kiosk mode. It's only allowed to be called repeatedly by the first extension to invoke this API.

#### Parameters

* seconds

  number

  Time to wait in seconds before rebooting the device, or -1 to cancel a scheduled reboot.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:

### sendMessage()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.sendMessage(

  message: any,  
  options?: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Sends a single message to event listeners within your extension or a different extension/app. Similar to [`runtime.connect`](#method-connect) but only sends a single message, with an optional response. If sending to your extension, the [`runtime.onMessage`](#event-onMessage) event will be fired in every frame of your extension (except for the sender's frame), or [`runtime.onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal), if a different extension. Note that extensions cannot send messages to content scripts using this method. To send messages to content scripts, use [`tabs.sendMessage`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-sendMessage).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to send the message to. If omitted, the message will be sent to your own extension/app. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable).
* message

  any

  The message to send. This message should be a JSON-ifiable object.
* options

  object optional

  + includeTlsChannelId

    boolean optional

    Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onMessageExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.
* callback

  function optional

### onRestartRequired

```
chrome.runtime.onRestartRequired.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when an app or the device that it runs on needs to be restarted. The app should close all its windows at its earliest convenient time to let the restart to happen. If the app does nothing, a restart will be enforced after a 24-hour grace period has passed. Currently, this event is only fired for Chrome OS kiosk apps.

Fired when a profile that has this extension installed first starts up. This event is not fired when an incognito profile is started, even if this extension is operating in 'split' incognito mode.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSuspend

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspend.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Sent to the event page just before it is unloaded. This gives the extension opportunity to do some clean up. Note that since the page is unloading, any asynchronous operations started while handling this event are not guaranteed to complete. If more activity for the event page occurs before it gets unloaded the onSuspendCanceled event will be sent and the page won't be unloaded.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSuspendCanceled

```
chrome.runtime.onSuspendCanceled.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Sent after onSuspend to indicate that the app won't be unloaded after all.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onUpdateAvailable

```
chrome.runtime.onUpdateAvailable.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when an update is available, but isn't installed immediately because the app is currently running. If you do nothing, the update will be installed the next time the background page gets unloaded, if you want it to be installed sooner you can explicitly call chrome.runtime.reload(). If your extension is using a persistent background page, the background page of course never gets unloaded, so unless you call chrome.runtime.reload() manually in response to this event the update will not get installed until the next time Chrome itself restarts. If no handlers are listening for this event, and your extension has a persistent background page, it behaves as if chrome.runtime.reload() is called in response to this event.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (details: object) => void
  ```

  + details

    object

    - version

      string

      The version number of the available update.

# chrome.runtime  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/

# chrome.runtime

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.runtime` API to retrieve the service worker, return details about the manifest, and listen for and respond to events in the extension lifecycle. You can also use this API to convert the relative path of URLs to fully-qualified URLs.

Most members of this API do **not** require any permissions. This permission is needed for [`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative), [`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage) and [`onNativeConnect`](#event-onConnectNative).

The following example shows how to declare the `"nativeMessaging"` permission in the manifest:

manifest.json:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "nativeMessaging"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

The Runtime API provides methods to support a number of areas that your extensions
can use:

Message passing
Your extension can communicate with different contexts within your extension and also with other extensions using these methods and events:
[`connect()`](#method-connect),
[`onConnect`](#event-onConnect),
[`onConnectExternal`](#event-onConnectExternal),
[`sendMessage()`](#method-sendMessage),
[`onMessage`](#event-onMessage) and
[`onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal).
In addition, your extension can pass messages to native applications on the user's device using
[`connectNative()`](#method-connectNative) and
[`sendNativeMessage()`](#method-sendNativeMessage).

Accessing extension and platform metadata
These methods let you retrieve several specific pieces of metadata about the extension and the
platform. Methods in this category include
[`getManifest()`](#method-getManifest), and
[`getPlatformInfo()`](#method-getPlatformInfo).
Managing extension lifecycle and options
These properties let you perform some meta-operations on the extension, and display the options page.
Methods and events in this category include
[`onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled),
[`onStartup`](#event-onStartup),
[`openOptionsPage()`](#method-openOptionsPage),
[`reload()`](#method-reload),
[`requestUpdateCheck()`](#method-requestUpdateCheck), and
[`setUninstallURL()`](#method-setUninstallURL).
Helper utilities
These methods provide utility such as the conversion of internal resource representations to
external formats. Methods in this category include
[`getURL()`](#method-getURL).
Kiosk mode utilities
These methods are available only on ChromeOS, and exist mainly to support kiosk implementations.
Methods in this category include
[`restart()`](#method-restart) and
[`restartAfterDelay()``](#method-restartAfterDelay).
### Unpacked extension behavior

When an [unpacked](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) extension is [reloaded](/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#reload), this is treated as an update. This means that the
[`chrome.runtime.onInstalled`](#event-onInstalled) event will fire with the `"update"` reason. This
includes when the extension is reloaded with [`chrome.runtime.reload()`](#method-reload).

## Use cases

### Add an image to a web page

For a web page to access an asset hosted on another domain, it must specify the resource's full URL
(e.g. `<img src="https://example.com/logo.png">`). The same is true to include an extension asset on
a web page. The two differences are that the extension's assets must be exposed as [web
accessible resources](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources) and that typically content scripts are responsible for injecting
extension assets.

In this example, the extension will add `logo.png` to the page that the [content
script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts) is being [injected](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts#functionality) into by using `runtime.getURL()` to create a
fully-qualified URL. But first, the asset must be declared as a web accessible resource in the manifest.

manifest.json:

```
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [ "logo.png" ],
      "matches": [ "https://*/*" ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}

```

content.js:

```
{ // Block used to avoid setting global variables
  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.src = chrome.runtime.getURL('logo.png');
  document.body.append(img);
}

```
### Send data from a content script to the service worker

Its common for an extension's content scripts to need data managed by another part of the extension,
like the service worker. Much like two browser windows opened to the same web page, these
two contexts cannot directly access each other's values. Instead, the extension can use [message
passing](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/messaging) to coordinate across these different contexts.

In this example, the content script needs some data from the extension's service worker to
initialize its UI. To get this data, it passes the developer-defined `get-user-data` message
to the service worker, and it responds with a copy of the user's information.

content.js:

```
// 1. Send a message to the service worker requesting the user's data
chrome.runtime.sendMessage('get-user-data', (response) => {
  // 3. Got an asynchronous response with the data from the service worker
  console.log('received user data', response);
  initializeUI(response);
});

```

service-worker.js:

```
// Example of a simple user data object
const user = {
  username: 'demo-user'
};

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  // 2. A page requested user data, respond with a copy of `user`
  if (message === 'get-user-data') {
    sendResponse(user);
  }
});

```
### Gather feedback on uninstall

Many extensions use post-uninstall surveys to understand how the extension could better serve its
users and improve retention. The following example shows how to add this functionality.

background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(details => {
  if (details.reason === chrome.runtime.OnInstalledReason.INSTALL) {
    chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL('https://example.com/extension-survey');
  }
});

```
## Examples

See the [Manifest V3 - Web Accessible Resources demo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/web-accessible-resources) for more Runtime API examples.

## Methods

### connect()

```
chrome.runtime.connect(  
  extensionId?: string,  
  connectInfo?: object,  
)
```

Attempts to connect listeners within an extension (such as the background page), or other extensions/apps. This is useful for content scripts connecting to their extension processes, inter-app/extension communication, and [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable). Note that this does not connect to any listeners in a content script. Extensions may connect to content scripts embedded in tabs via [`tabs.connect`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-connect).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to connect to. If omitted, a connection will be attempted with your own extension. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/externally-connectable).
* connectInfo

  object optional

  + includeTlsChannelId

    boolean optional

    Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into onConnectExternal for processes that are listening for the connection event.
  + name

    string optional

    Will be passed into onConnect for processes that are listening for the connection event.
#### Returns

* [Port](#type-Port)

  Port through which messages can be sent and received. The port's [onDisconnect](#type-Port) event is fired if the extension does not exist.
### connectNative()

```
chrome.runtime.connectNative(  
  application: string,  
)
```

Connects to a native application in the host machine. This method requires the `"nativeMessaging"` permission. See [Native Messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/native-messaging) for more information.

#### Parameters

### getURL()

```
chrome.runtime.getURL(  
  path: string,  
)
```

Converts a relative path within an app/extension install directory to a fully-qualified URL.

#### Parameters

* path

  string

  A path to a resource within an app/extension expressed relative to its install directory.
#### Returns

* string

  The fully-qualified URL to the resource.
### openOptionsPage()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Open your Extension's options page, if possible.

The precise behavior may depend on your manifest's [`options_ui`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#embedded_options) or [`options_page`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page#full_page) key, or what Chrome happens to support at the time. For example, the page may be opened in a new tab, within chrome://extensions, within an App, or it may just focus an open options page. It will never cause the caller page to reload.

If your Extension does not declare an options page, or Chrome failed to create one for some other reason, the callback will set [`lastError`](#property-lastError).

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 99+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### reload()

```
chrome.runtime.reload()
```

Reloads the app or extension. This method is not supported in kiosk mode. For kiosk mode, use chrome.runtime.restart() method.

### requestUpdateCheck()

Promise

```
chrome.runtime.requestUpdateCheck(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Requests an immediate update check be done for this app/extension.

**Important**: Most extensions/apps should **not** use this method, since Chrome already does automatic checks every few hours, and you can listen for the [`runtime.onUpdateAvailable`](#event-onUpdateAvailable) event without needing to call requestUpdateCheck.

This method is only appropriate to call in very limited circumstances, such as if your extension talks to a backend service, and the backend service has determined that the client extension version is very far out of date and you'd like to prompt a user to update. Most other uses of requestUpdateCheck, such as calling it unconditionally based on a repeating timer, probably only serve to waste client, network, and server resources.

Note: When called with a callback, instead of returning an object this function will return the two properties as separate arguments passed to the callback.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (result: object) => void
  ```

  + result

    object

    Chrome 109+

    RequestUpdateCheckResult object that holds the status of the update check and any details of the result if there is an update available

    - status

      [RequestUpdateCheckStatus](#type-RequestUpdateCheckStatus)

      Result of the update check.
    - version

      string optional

      If an update is available, this contains the version of the available update.
#### Returns

* Promise<object>

  Chrome 109+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### restart()

```
chrome.runtime.restart()
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode. Otherwise, it's no-op.

### restartAfterDelay()

```
chrome.runtime.restartAfterDelay(  
  seconds: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Restart the ChromeOS device when the app runs in kiosk mode after the given seconds. If called again before the time ends, the reboot will be delayed. If called with a value of -1, the reboot will be cancelled. It's a no-op in non-kiosk mode. It's only allowed to be called repeatedly by the first extension to invoke this API.

#### Parameters

* seconds

  number

  Time to wait in seconds before rebooting the device, or -1 to cancel a scheduled reboot.

)
```

Sends a single message to event listeners within your extension or a different extension/app. Similar to [`runtime.connect`](#method-connect) but only sends a single message, with an optional response. If sending to your extension, the [`runtime.onMessage`](#event-onMessage) event will be fired in every frame of your extension (except for the sender's frame), or [`runtime.onMessageExternal`](#event-onMessageExternal), if a different extension. Note that extensions cannot send messages to content scripts using this method. To send messages to content scripts, use [`tabs.sendMessage`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-sendMessage).

#### Parameters

* extensionId

  string optional

  The ID of the extension to send the message to. If omitted, the message will be sent to your own extension/app. Required if sending messages from a web page for [web messaging](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/manifest/externally_connectable).

```

Fired when an update is available, but isn't installed immediately because the app is currently running. If you do nothing, the update will be installed the next time the background page gets unloaded, if you want it to be installed sooner you can explicitly call chrome.runtime.reload(). If your extension is using a persistent background page, the background page of course never gets unloaded, so unless you call chrome.runtime.reload() manually in response to this event the update will not get installed until the next time Chrome itself restarts. If no handlers are listening for this event, and your extension has a persistent background page, it behaves as if chrome.runtime.reload() is called in response to this event.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (details: object) => void
  ```

  + details

    object

    - version

      string

### onUserScriptConnect

Chrome 115+
MV3+

```
chrome.runtime.onUserScriptConnect.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when a connection is made from a user script from this extension.

# chrome.scripting  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/scripting

# chrome.scripting

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.scripting` API to execute script in different contexts.

## Permissions

`scripting`  
## Availability

Chrome 88+
MV3+

## Manifest

To use the `chrome.scripting` API, declare the `"scripting"` permission in the [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) plus the host permissions for the pages to inject scripts into. Use the [`"host_permissions"`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) key or the [`"activeTab"`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, which grants temporary host permissions. The following example uses the activeTab permission.

```
{
  "name": "Scripting Extension",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab"],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

You can use the `chrome.scripting` API to inject JavaScript and CSS into
websites. This is similar to what you can do with [content
scripts](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts). But by using the [`chrome.scripting`](/docs/extensions/reference/scripting) namespace, extensions
can make decisions at runtime.

### Injection targets

You can use the `target` parameter to specify a target to inject JavaScript or
CSS into.

The only required field is `tabId`. By default, an injection will run in the
main frame of the specified tab.

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("script injected"));

```

To run in all frames of the specified tab, you can set the `allFrames` boolean
to `true`.

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("script injected in all frames"));

```

You can also inject into specific frames of a tab by specifying individual frame
IDs. For more information on frame IDs, see the [`chrome.webNavigation`
API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webNavigation).

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), frameIds : [ frameId1, frameId2 ]},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("script injected on target frames"));

```
### Injected code

Extensions can specify the code to be injected either via an external file or a
runtime variable.

#### Files

Files are specified as strings that are paths relative to the extension's root
directory. The following code will inject the file `script.js` into the main
frame of the tab.

```
function getTabId() { ... }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      files : [ "script.js" ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected script file"));

```
#### Runtime functions

When injecting JavaScript with `scripting.executeScript()`, you can specify a
function to be executed instead of a file. This function should be a function
variable available to the current extension context.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getTitle() { return document.title; }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : getTitle,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```
```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getUserColor() { ... }

function changeBackgroundColor() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = getUserColor();
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : changeBackgroundColor,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```

You can work around this by using the `args` property:

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getUserColor() { ... }
function changeBackgroundColor(backgroundColor) {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = backgroundColor;
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : changeBackgroundColor,
      args : [ getUserColor() ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```
#### Runtime strings

If injecting CSS within a page, you can also specify a string to be used in the
`css` property. This option is only available for `scripting.insertCSS()`; you
can't execute a string using `scripting.executeScript()`.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
const css = "body { background-color: red; }";

chrome.scripting
    .insertCSS({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      css : css,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("CSS injected"));

```
### Handle the results

The results of executing JavaScript are passed to the extension. A single result
is included per-frame. The main frame is guaranteed to be the first index in the
resulting array; all other frames are in a non-deterministic order.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getTitle() { return document.title; }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      func : getTitle,
    })
    .then(injectionResults => {
      for (const {frameId, result} of injectionResults) {
        console.log(`Frame ${frameId} result:`, result);
      }
    });

```

`scripting.insertCSS()` does not return any results.

#### Promises

If the resulting value of the script execution is a promise, Chrome will wait
for the promise to settle and return the resulting value.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
async function addIframe() {
  const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
  const loadComplete =
      new Promise(resolve => iframe.addEventListener("load", resolve));
  iframe.src = "https://example.com";
  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
  await loadComplete;
  return iframe.contentWindow.document.title;
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      func : addIframe,
    })
    .then(injectionResults => {
      for (const frameResult of injectionResults) {
        const {frameId, result} = frameResult;
        console.log(`Frame ${frameId} result:`, result);
      }
    });

```
## Examples

### Unregister all dynamic content scripts

The following snippet contains a function that unregisters all dynamic content
scripts the extension has previously registered.

```
async function unregisterAllDynamicContentScripts() {
  try {
    const scripts = await chrome.scripting.getRegisteredContentScripts();
    const scriptIds = scripts.map(script => script.id);
    return chrome.scripting.unregisterContentScripts(scriptIds);
  } catch (error) {
    const message = [
      "An unexpected error occurred while",
      "unregistering dynamic content scripts.",
    ].join(" ");
    throw new Error(message, {cause : error});
  }
}

```

To try the `chrome.scripting` API,
install the [scripting sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/scripting) from the [Chrome extension samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples)
repository.

  number

  Chrome 90+

  The frame associated with the injection.
* result

  any optional

  The result of the script execution.
### InjectionTarget

#### Properties

* tabId

  number

  The ID of the tab into which to inject.
### RegisteredContentScript

Chrome 96+

#### Properties

* allFrames

  boolean optional

  If specified true, it will inject into all frames, even if the frame is not the top-most frame in the tab. Each frame is checked independently for URL requirements; it will not inject into child frames if the URL requirements are not met. Defaults to false, meaning that only the top frame is matched.
* css

* target

  [InjectionTarget](#type-InjectionTarget)

  Details specifying the target into which to inject the script.
* world

  [ExecutionWorld](#type-ExecutionWorld) optional

  Chrome 95+

  The JavaScript "world" to run the script in. Defaults to `ISOLATED`.
* func

  void optional

  Chrome 92+

  A JavaScript function to inject. This function will be serialized, and then deserialized for injection. This means that any bound parameters and execution context will be lost. Exactly one of `files` or `func` must be specified.

  The `func` function looks like:
  ```
  () => {...}
  ```
### StyleOrigin

The origin for a style change. See [style origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Style_origin) for more info.

## Methods

### executeScript()

Promise

```
chrome.scripting.executeScript(  
  injection: [ScriptInjection](#type-ScriptInjection),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Injects a script into a target context. By default, the script will be run at `document_idle`, or immediately if the page has already loaded. If the `injectImmediately` property is set, the script will inject without waiting, even if the page has not finished loading. If the script evaluates to a promise, the browser will wait for the promise to settle and return the resulting value.

#### Parameters

* injection

  [ScriptInjection](#type-ScriptInjection)

  The details of the script which to inject.

```
### Injected code

Extensions can specify the code to be injected either via an external file or a

#### Files

Files are specified as strings that are paths relative to the extension's root

    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : changeBackgroundColor,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```

You can work around this by using the `args` property:

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getUserColor() { ... }
function changeBackgroundColor(backgroundColor) {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = backgroundColor;
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      func : changeBackgroundColor,
      args : [ getUserColor() ],
    })
    .then(() => console.log("injected a function"));

```
#### Runtime strings

If injecting CSS within a page, you can also specify a string to be used in the
`css` property. This option is only available for `scripting.insertCSS()`; you
can't execute a string using `scripting.executeScript()`.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
const css = "body { background-color: red; }";

chrome.scripting
    .insertCSS({
      target : {tabId : getTabId()},
      css : css,
    })
    .then(() => console.log("CSS injected"));

```
### Handle the results

The results of executing JavaScript are passed to the extension. A single result
is included per-frame. The main frame is guaranteed to be the first index in the
resulting array; all other frames are in a non-deterministic order.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
function getTitle() { return document.title; }

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      func : getTitle,
    })
    .then(injectionResults => {
      for (const {frameId, result} of injectionResults) {
        console.log(`Frame ${frameId} result:`, result);
      }
    });

```

`scripting.insertCSS()` does not return any results.

#### Promises

If the resulting value of the script execution is a promise, Chrome will wait
for the promise to settle and return the resulting value.

```
function getTabId() { ... }
async function addIframe() {
  const iframe = document.createElement("iframe");
  const loadComplete =
      new Promise(resolve => iframe.addEventListener("load", resolve));
  iframe.src = "https://example.com";
  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
  await loadComplete;
  return iframe.contentWindow.document.title;
}

chrome.scripting
    .executeScript({
      target : {tabId : getTabId(), allFrames : true},
      func : addIframe,
    })
    .then(injectionResults => {
      for (const frameResult of injectionResults) {
        const {frameId, result} = frameResult;
        console.log(`Frame ${frameId} result:`, result);
      }
    });

```
## Examples

### Unregister all dynamic content scripts

The following snippet contains a function that unregisters all dynamic content
scripts the extension has previously registered.

```
async function unregisterAllDynamicContentScripts() {
  try {
    const scripts = await chrome.scripting.getRegisteredContentScripts();
    const scriptIds = scripts.map(script => script.id);
    return chrome.scripting.unregisterContentScripts(scriptIds);
  } catch (error) {
    const message = [
      "An unexpected error occurred while",
      "unregistering dynamic content scripts.",
    ].join(" ");
    throw new Error(message, {cause : error});
  }
}

```

* target

  [InjectionTarget](#type-InjectionTarget)

  Details specifying the target into which to inject the script.
* world

  [ExecutionWorld](#type-ExecutionWorld) optional

  Chrome 95+

  The JavaScript "world" to run the script in. Defaults to `ISOLATED`.
* func

  void optional

  Chrome 92+

  A JavaScript function to inject. This function will be serialized, and then deserialized for injection. This means that any bound parameters and execution context will be lost. Exactly one of `files` or `func` must be specified.

  The `func` function looks like:
  ```
  () => {...}
  ```
### StyleOrigin

The origin for a style change. See [style origins](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Style_origin) for more info.

  callback?: function,  
)
```

Injects a script into a target context. By default, the script will be run at `document_idle`, or immediately if the page has already loaded. If the `injectImmediately` property is set, the script will inject without waiting, even if the page has not finished loading. If the script evaluates to a promise, the browser will wait for the promise to settle and return the resulting value.

#### Parameters

# chrome.storage  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage

# chrome.storage

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.storage` API to store, retrieve, and track changes to user data.

## Permissions

`storage`  

To use the storage API, declare the `"storage"` permission in the extension
[manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "storage"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

The Storage API provides an extension-specific way to persist user data and state. It's similar to the web platform's storage APIs ([IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/indexeddb), and [Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage)), but was designed to meet the storage needs of extensions. The following are a few key features:

* All extension contexts, including the extension service worker and content scripts have access to the Storage API.
* The JSON serializable values are stored as object properties.
* The Storage API is asynchronous with bulk read and write operations.
* Even if the user clears the cache and browsing history, the data persists.
* Stored settings persist even when using [split incognito](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/incognito).
* Includes an exclusive read-only [managed storage area](#property-managed) for enterprise policies.

### Can extensions use web storage APIs?

While extensions can use the [`Storage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Storage) interface (accessible from `window.localStorage`) in some contexts (popup and other HTML pages), we don't recommend it for the following reasons:

* Extension service workers can't use the Web Storage API.
* Content scripts share storage with the host page.
* Data saved using the Web Storage API is lost when the user clears their browsing history.

To move data from web storage APIs to extension storage APIs from a service worker:

1. Prepare an offscreen document html page and script file. The script file should contain a conversion routine and an [`onMessage`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#event-onMessage) handler.
2. In the extension service worker, check `chrome.storage` for your data.
3. If your data isn't found, call [`createDocument()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/offscreen#method-createDocument).
4. After the returned Promise resolves, call [`sendMessage()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#method-sendMessage) to start the conversion routine.
5. Inside the offscreen document's `onMessage` handler, call the conversion routine.

There are also some nuances to how web storage APIs work in extensions. Learn more in the
[Storage and Cookies](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/storage-and-cookies) article.

### Storage areas

The Storage API is divided into the following storage areas:

[`storage.local`](#property-local)
Data is stored locally and cleared when the extension is removed. The storage limit is 10 MB (5 MB in Chrome 113 and earlier), but can be increased by requesting the `"unlimitedStorage"` permission. We recommend using `storage.local` to store larger amounts of data.
[`storage.managed`](#property-managed)
Managed storage is read-only storage for policy installed extensions and managed by system administrators using a developer-defined schema and enterprise policies. Policies are analogous to options but are configured by a system administrator instead of the user, allowing the extension to be preconfigured for all users of an organization. For information on policies, see [Documentation for Administrators](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/). To learn more about the `managed` storage area, see [Manifest for storage areas](/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage).
[`storage.session`](#property-session)
Holds data in memory for the duration of a browser session. By default, it's not exposed to content scripts, but this behavior can be changed by setting [`chrome.storage.session.setAccessLevel()`](#method-StorageArea-setAccessLevel). The storage limit is 10 MB (1 MB in Chrome 111 and earlier). The`storage.session` interface is one of several [we recommend for service workers](/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers/service-worker-lifecycle#persist-data).
[`storage.sync`](#property-sync)
If syncing is enabled, the data is synced to any Chrome browser that the user is logged into. If disabled, it behaves like `storage.local`. Chrome stores the data locally when the browser is offline and resumes syncing when it's back online. The quota limitation is approximately 100 KB, 8 KB per item. We recommend using `storage.sync` to preserve user settings across synced browsers. If you're working with sensitive user data, instead use `storage.session`.
### Storage and throttling limits

The Storage API has the following usage limitations:

* Storing data often comes with performance costs, and the API includes storage quotas. We recommend being careful about what data you store so that you don't lose the ability to store data.
* Storage can take time to complete. Make sure to structure your code to account for that time.

For details on storage area limitations and what happens when they're exceeded, see the quota information for [`sync`](#property-sync), [`local`](#property-local), and [`session`](#property-session).

## Use cases

The following sections demonstrate common use cases for the Storage API.

### Synchronous response to storage updates

To track changes made to storage, add a listener to its `onChanged` event. When anything changes in storage, that event fires. The sample code listens for these changes:

background.js:

```
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, namespace) => {
  for (let [key, { oldValue, newValue }] of Object.entries(changes)) {
    console.log(
      `Storage key "${key}" in namespace "${namespace}" changed.`,
      `Old value was "${oldValue}", new value is "${newValue}".`
    );
  }
});

```

We can take this idea even further. In this example, we have an [options page](/docs/extensions/develop/ui/options-page) that
allows the user to toggle a "debug mode" (implementation not shown here). The options page immediately saves the new settings to `storage.sync`, and the service worker uses `storage.onChanged` to apply the setting as soon as possible.

options.html:

```
<!-- type="module" allows you to use top level await -->
<script defer src="options.js" type="module"></script>
<form id="optionsForm">
  <label for="debug">
    <input type="checkbox" name="debug" id="debug">
    Enable debug mode
  </label>
</form>

```

options.js:

```
// In-page cache of the user's options
const options = {};
const optionsForm = document.getElementById("optionsForm");

// Immediately persist options changes
optionsForm.debug.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  options.debug = event.target.checked;
  chrome.storage.sync.set({ options });
});

// Initialize the form with the user's option settings
const data = await chrome.storage.sync.get("options");
Object.assign(options, data.options);
optionsForm.debug.checked = Boolean(options.debug);

```

background.js:

```
function setDebugMode() { /* ... */ }

// Watch for changes to the user's options & apply them
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener((changes, area) => {
  if (area === 'sync' && changes.options?.newValue) {
    const debugMode = Boolean(changes.options.newValue.debug);
    console.log('enable debug mode?', debugMode);
    setDebugMode(debugMode);
  }
});

```
### Asynchronous preload from storage

Because service workers don't run all the time, Manifest V3 extensions sometimes need to
asynchronously load data from storage before they execute their event handlers. To do this, the
following snippet uses an async `action.onClicked` event handler that waits for the `storageCache`
global to be populated before executing its logic.

background.js:

```
// Where we will expose all the data we retrieve from storage.sync.
const storageCache = { count: 0 };
// Asynchronously retrieve data from storage.sync, then cache it.
const initStorageCache = chrome.storage.sync.get().then((items) => {
  // Copy the data retrieved from storage into storageCache.
  Object.assign(storageCache, items);
});

chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(async (tab) => {
  try {
    await initStorageCache;
  } catch (e) {
    // Handle error that occurred during storage initialization.
  }

  // Normal action handler logic.
  storageCache.count++;
  storageCache.lastTabId = tab.id;
  chrome.storage.sync.set(storageCache);
});

```
## Examples

The following samples demonstrate the `local`, `sync`, and
`session` storage areas:

### Local

```
chrome.storage.local.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
  console.log("Value is set");
});

chrome.storage.local.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
  console.log("Value is " + result.key);
});

```

### Sync

```
chrome.storage.sync.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
  console.log("Value is set");
});

chrome.storage.sync.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
  console.log("Value is " + result.key);
});

```

### Session

```
chrome.storage.session.set({ key: value }).then(() => {
  console.log("Value was set");
});

chrome.storage.session.get(["key"]).then((result) => {
  console.log("Value is " + result.key);
});

```

### StorageChange

#### Properties

* newValue

  any optional

  The new value of the item, if there is a new value.
* oldValue

  any optional

  The old value of the item, if there was an old value.
## Properties

### local

Items in the `local` storage area are local to each machine.

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea) & object

#### Properties

* QUOTA\_BYTES

  10485760   

  The maximum amount (in bytes) of data that can be stored in local storage, as measured by the JSON stringification of every value plus every key's length. This value will be ignored if the extension has the `unlimitedStorage` permission. Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or a rejected Promise if using async/await.
### managed

Items in the `managed` storage area are set by an enterprise policy configured by the domain administrator, and are read-only for the extension; trying to modify this namespace results in an error. For information on configuring a policy, see [Manifest for storage areas](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/storage).

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea)

### session

Chrome 102+
MV3+

Items in the `session` storage area are stored in-memory and will not be persisted to disk.

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea) & object

#### Properties

* QUOTA\_BYTES

  10485760   

  The maximum amount (in bytes) of data that can be stored in memory, as measured by estimating the dynamically allocated memory usage of every value and key. Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
### sync

Items in the `sync` storage area are synced using Chrome Sync.

#### Type

[StorageArea](#type-StorageArea) & object

#### Properties

* MAX\_ITEMS

  512   

  The maximum number of items that can be stored in sync storage. Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded will fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
* MAX\_SUSTAINED\_WRITE\_OPERATIONS\_PER\_MINUTE

  1000000   

  Deprecated

  The storage.sync API no longer has a sustained write operation quota.
* MAX\_WRITE\_OPERATIONS\_PER\_HOUR

  1800   

  The maximum number of `set`, `remove`, or `clear` operations that can be performed each hour. This is 1 every 2 seconds, a lower ceiling than the short term higher writes-per-minute limit.

  Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
* MAX\_WRITE\_OPERATIONS\_PER\_MINUTE

  120   

  The maximum number of `set`, `remove`, or `clear` operations that can be performed each minute. This is 2 per second, providing higher throughput than writes-per-hour over a shorter period of time.

  Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
* QUOTA\_BYTES

  102400   

  The maximum total amount (in bytes) of data that can be stored in sync storage, as measured by the JSON stringification of every value plus every key's length. Updates that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
* QUOTA\_BYTES\_PER\_ITEM

  8192   

  The maximum size (in bytes) of each individual item in sync storage, as measured by the JSON stringification of its value plus its key length. Updates containing items larger than this limit will fail immediately and set [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#property-lastError) when using a callback, or when a Promise is rejected.
## Events

### onChanged

```
chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when one or more items change.

#### Parameters

# chrome.tabs  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/

# chrome.tabs

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.tabs` API to interact with the browser's tab system. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange tabs in the browser.

The Tabs API not only offers features for manipulating and managing tabs, but can also detect the
[language](#method-detectLanguage) of the tab, take a [screenshot](#method-captureVisibleTab), and
[communicate](#method-sendMessage) with a tab's content scripts.

## Permissions

Most features don't require any permissions to use. For example: [creating](#method-create) a new tab,
[reloading](#method-reload) a tab, [navigating](#method-update) to another URL, etc.

There are three permissions developers should be aware of when working with the Tabs API.

The "tabs" permission

This permission does not give access to the `chrome.tabs` namespace. Instead, it
grants an extension the ability to call [`tabs.query()`](#method-query) against four
sensitive properties on [`tabs.Tab`](#type-Tab) instances: `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and
`favIconUrl`.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "tabs"
  ],
  ...
}

```

Host permissions

[Host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) allow an extension to read and query a matching tab's four sensitive
`tabs.Tab` properties. They can also interact directly with the matching tabs using methods such
as [`tabs.captureVisibleTab()`](#method-captureVisibleTab),
[`tabs.executeScript()`](#method-executeScript), [`tabs.insertCSS()`](#method-insertCSS), and
[`tabs.removeCSS()`](#method-removeCSS).

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "host_permissions": [
    "http://*/*",
    "https://*/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```

The "activeTab" permission

[`activeTab`](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) grants an extension temporary host permission for the current tab in
response to a user invocation. Unlike host permissions, `activeTab` does not trigger any warnings.

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ],
  ...
}

```

## Use cases

The following sections demonstrate some common use cases.

### Open an extension page in a new tab

A common pattern for extensions is to open an onboarding page in a new tab when the extension is
installed. The following example shows how to do this.

background.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(({reason}) => {
  if (reason === 'install') {
    chrome.tabs.create({
      url: "onboarding.html"
    });
  }
});

```
### Get the current tab

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can retrieve the active tab from the
currently-focused window (or most recently-focused window, if no Chrome windows are focused). This
can usually be thought of as the user's current tab.

```
  async function getCurrentTab() {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
    let [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions);
    return tab;
  }

```
```
  function getCurrentTab(callback) {
    let queryOptions = { active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true };
    chrome.tabs.query(queryOptions, ([tab]) => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError)
      console.error(chrome.runtime.lastError);
      // `tab` will either be a `tabs.Tab` instance or `undefined`.
      callback(tab);
    });
  }

```
### Mute the specified tab

This example shows how an extension can toggle the muted state for a given tab.

```
  async function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    const tab = await chrome.tabs.get(tabId);
    const muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
    await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, {muted});
    console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${muted ? "muted" : "unmuted"}`);
  }

```
```
  function toggleMuteState(tabId) {
    chrome.tabs.get(tabId, async (tab) => {
      let muted = !tab.mutedInfo.muted;
      await chrome.tabs.update(tabId, { muted });
      console.log(`Tab ${tab.id} is ${ muted ? "muted" : "unmuted" }`);
    });
  }

```
### Move the current tab to the first position when clicked

This example shows how to move a tab while a drag may or may not be in progress. While this example
uses `chrome.tabs.move`, you can use the same waiting pattern for other calls that modify tabs while
a drag is in progress.

```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPosition);

  async function moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo) {
    try {
      await chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, {index: 0});
      console.log("Success.");
    } catch (error) {
      if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
        setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPosition(activeInfo), 50);
      } else {
        console.error(error);
      }
    }
  }

```
```
  chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(moveToFirstPositionMV2);

  function moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo) {
    chrome.tabs.move(activeInfo.tabId, { index: 0 }, () => {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
        const error = chrome.runtime.lastError;
        if (error == "Error: Tabs cannot be edited right now (user may be dragging a tab).") {
          setTimeout(() => moveToFirstPositionMV2(activeInfo), 50);
        } else {
          console.error(error);
        }
      } else {
        console.log("Success.");
      }
    });
  }

```
### Pass a message to a selected tab's content script

This example demonstrates how an extension's service worker can communicate with content scripts in specific browser tabs using `tabs.sendMessage()`.

```
function sendMessageToActiveTab(message) {
  const [tab] = await chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, lastFocusedWindow: true });
  const response = await chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, message);
  // TODO: Do something with the response.
}

```

  number optional

  Chrome 43+

  Used to return the default zoom level for the current tab in calls to tabs.getZoomSettings.
* mode

  [ZoomSettingsMode](#type-ZoomSettingsMode) optional

  Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.
* scope

  [ZoomSettingsScope](#type-ZoomSettingsScope) optional

  Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.
### ZoomSettingsMode

Chrome 44+

Defines how zoom changes are handled, i.e., which entity is responsible for the actual scaling of the page; defaults to `automatic`.

#### Enum

"automatic"   
 Zoom changes are handled automatically by the browser.

"manual"   
 Overrides the automatic handling of zoom changes. The `onZoomChange` event will still be dispatched, and it is the extension's responsibility to listen for this event and manually scale the page. This mode does not support `per-origin` zooming, and thus ignores the `scope` zoom setting and assumes `per-tab`.

"disabled"   
 Disables all zooming in the tab. The tab reverts to the default zoom level, and all attempted zoom changes are ignored.

### ZoomSettingsScope

Chrome 44+

Defines whether zoom changes persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab; defaults to `per-origin` when in `automatic` mode, and `per-tab` otherwise.

#### Enum

"per-origin"   
 Zoom changes persist in the zoomed page's origin, i.e., all other tabs navigated to that same origin are zoomed as well. Moreover, `per-origin` zoom changes are saved with the origin, meaning that when navigating to other pages in the same origin, they are all zoomed to the same zoom factor. The `per-origin` scope is only available in the `automatic` mode.

"per-tab"   
 Zoom changes only take effect in this tab, and zoom changes in other tabs do not affect the zooming of this tab. Also, `per-tab` zoom changes are reset on navigation; navigating a tab always loads pages with their `per-origin` zoom factors.

## Properties

### MAX\_CAPTURE\_VISIBLE\_TAB\_CALLS\_PER\_SECOND

Chrome 92+

The maximum number of times that [`captureVisibleTab`](#method-captureVisibleTab) can be called per second. [`captureVisibleTab`](#method-captureVisibleTab) is expensive and should not be called too often.

#### Value

2   

### TAB\_ID\_NONE

Chrome 46+

An ID that represents the absence of a browser tab.

#### Value

-1   

### TAB\_INDEX\_NONE

Chrome 123+

An index that represents the absence of a tab index in a tab\_strip.

#### Value

-1   

## Methods

### captureVisibleTab()

Promise

```
chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab(  
  windowId?: number,  
  options?: [ImageDetails](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes/#type-ImageDetails),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Captures the visible area of the currently active tab in the specified window. In order to call this method, the extension must have either the [<all\_urls>](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) permission or the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission. In addition to sites that extensions can normally access, this method allows extensions to capture sensitive sites that are otherwise restricted, including chrome:-scheme pages, other extensions' pages, and data: URLs. These sensitive sites can only be captured with the activeTab permission. File URLs may be captured only if the extension has been granted file access.

#### Parameters

* windowId

  number optional

  The target window. Defaults to the [current window](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/windows/#current-window).
* options

  [ImageDetails](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes/#type-ImageDetails) optional

# chrome.tts  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tts/

# chrome.tts

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.tts` API to play synthesized text-to-speech (TTS). See also the related [`ttsEngine`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/ttsEngine/) API, which allows an extension to implement a speech engine.

Chrome provides this capability on Windows (using SAPI 5), Mac OS X, and ChromeOS, using
speech synthesis capabilities provided by the operating system. On all platforms, the user can
install extensions that register themselves as alternative speech engines.

## Permissions

`tts`  
## Concepts and usage

### Generate speech

Call `speak()` from your extension to speak. For example:

```
chrome.tts.speak('Hello, world.');

```

To stop speaking immediately, just call `stop()`:

```
chrome.tts.stop();

```

You can provide options that control various properties of the speech, such as its rate, pitch, and
more. For example:

```
chrome.tts.speak('Hello, world.', {'rate': 2.0});

```

It's also a good idea to specify the language so that a synthesizer supporting that language (and
regional dialect, if applicable) is chosen.

```
chrome.tts.speak('Hello, world.', {'lang': 'en-US', 'rate': 2.0});

```

By default, each call to `speak()` interrupts any ongoing speech and speaks immediately. To
determine if a call would be interrupting anything, you can call `isSpeaking()`. In addition, you
can use the `enqueue` option to cause this utterance to be added to a queue of utterances that will
be spoken when the current utterance has finished.

```
chrome.tts.speak('Speak this first.');
chrome.tts.speak(
    'Speak this next, when the first sentence is done.', {'enqueue': true});

```

A complete description of all options can be found under [`tts.speak()`](#method-speak). Not all speech
engines will support all options.

To catch errors and make sure you're calling `speak()` correctly, pass a callback function that
takes no arguments. Inside the callback, check [`runtime.lastError`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#property-lastError) to see if there were any
errors.

```
chrome.tts.speak(
  utterance,
  options,
  function() {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      console.log('Error: ' + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
    }
  }
);

```

The callback returns right away, before the engine has started generating speech. The purpose of the
callback is to alert you to syntax errors in your use of the TTS API, not to catch all possible
errors that might occur in the process of synthesizing and outputting speech. To catch these errors
too, you need to use an event listener, described in the next section.

### Listen to events

To get more real-time information about the status of synthesized speech, pass an event listener in
the options to `speak()`, like this:

```
chrome.tts.speak(
  utterance,
  {
    onEvent: function(event) {
      console.log('Event ' + event.type + ' at position ' + event.charIndex);
      if (event.type == 'error') {
        console.log('Error: ' + event.errorMessage);
      }
    }
  },
  callback
);

```

Each event includes an event type, the character index of the current speech relative to the
utterance, and for error events, an optional error message. The event types are:

* `'start'`: The engine has started speaking the utterance.
* `'word'`: A word boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'sentence'`: A sentence boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current
  speech position.
* `'marker'`: An SSML marker was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'end'`: The engine has finished speaking the utterance.
* `'interrupted'`: This utterance was interrupted by another call to `speak()` or `stop()` and did
  not finish.
* `'cancelled'`: This utterance was queued, but then cancelled by another call to `speak()` or
  `stop()` and never began to speak at all.
* `'error'`: An engine-specific error occurred and this utterance cannot be spoken. Check
  `event.errorMessage` for details.

Four of the event types—`'end'`, `'interrupted'`, `'cancelled'`, and `'error'`—are *final*. After
one of those events is received, this utterance will no longer speak and no new events from this
utterance will be received.

Some voices may not support all event types, and some voices may not send any events at all. If you
don't want to use a voice unless it sends certain events, pass the events you require in the
`requiredEventTypes` member of the options object, or use `getVoices()` to choose a voice that meets
your requirements. Both are described in what follows.

### SSML markup

Utterances used in this API may include markup using the [Speech Synthesis Markup Language
(SSML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis). If you use SSML, the first argument to `speak()` should be a complete SSML document with
an XML header and a top-level `<speak>` tag, not a document fragment.

For example:

```
chrome.tts.speak(
  '<?xml version="1.0"?>' +
  '<speak>' +
  '  The <emphasis>second</emphasis> ' +
  '  word of this sentence was emphasized.' +
  '</speak>'
);

```

Not all speech engines will support all SSML tags, and some may not support SSML at all, but all
engines are required to ignore any SSML they don't support and to still speak the underlying text.

### Choose a voice

By default, Chrome chooses the most appropriate voice for each utterance you want to speak, based on
the language. On most Windows, Mac OS X, and ChromeOS systems, speech synthesis provided by the
operating system should be able to speak any text in at least one language. Some users may have a
variety of voices available, though, from their operating system and from speech engines implemented
by other Chrome extensions. In those cases, you can implement custom code to choose the appropriate
voice, or to present the user with a list of choices.

To get a list of all voices, call `getVoices()` and pass it a function that receives an array of
`TtsVoice` objects as its argument:

```
chrome.tts.getVoices(
  function(voices) {
    for (var i = 0; i < voices.length; i++) {
      console.log('Voice ' + i + ':');
      console.log('  name: ' + voices[i].voiceName);
      console.log('  lang: ' + voices[i].lang);
      console.log('  extension id: ' + voices[i].extensionId);

## Types

### EventType

Chrome 54+

#### Enum

"start"   

"end"   

"word"   

"sentence"   

"marker"   

"interrupted"   

"cancelled"   

"error"   

"pause"   

"resume"   

### TtsEvent

An event from the TTS engine to communicate the status of an utterance.

#### Properties

* charIndex

  number optional

  The index of the current character in the utterance. For word events, the event fires at the end of one word and before the beginning of the next. The `charIndex` represents a point in the text at the beginning of the next word to be spoken.
* errorMessage

  string optional

  The error description, if the event type is `error`.
* length

  number optional

  Chrome 74+

  The length of the next part of the utterance. For example, in a `word` event, this is the length of the word which will be spoken next. It will be set to -1 if not set by the speech engine.
* type

  [EventType](#type-EventType)

  The type can be `start` as soon as speech has started, `word` when a word boundary is reached, `sentence` when a sentence boundary is reached, `marker` when an SSML mark element is reached, `end` when the end of the utterance is reached, `interrupted` when the utterance is stopped or interrupted before reaching the end, `cancelled` when it's removed from the queue before ever being synthesized, or `error` when any other error occurs. When pausing speech, a `pause` event is fired if a particular utterance is paused in the middle, and `resume` if an utterance resumes speech. Note that pause and resume events may not fire if speech is paused in-between utterances.
### TtsOptions

Chrome 77+

The speech options for the TTS engine.

#### Properties

* desiredEventTypes

  string[] optional

  The TTS event types that you are interested in listening to. If missing, all event types may be sent.
* enqueue

  boolean optional

  If true, enqueues this utterance if TTS is already in progress. If false (the default), interrupts any current speech and flushes the speech queue before speaking this new utterance.
* extensionId

  string optional

  The extension ID of the speech engine to use, if known.
* gender

  [VoiceGender](#type-VoiceGender) optional

  Deprecated since Chrome 77

  Gender is deprecated and will be ignored.

  Gender of voice for synthesized speech.
* lang

* pitch

  number optional

  Speaking pitch between 0 and 2 inclusive, with 0 being lowest and 2 being highest. 1.0 corresponds to a voice's default pitch.
* rate

  number optional

  Speaking rate relative to the default rate for this voice. 1.0 is the default rate, normally around 180 to 220 words per minute. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. Values below 0.1 or above 10.0 are strictly disallowed, but many voices will constrain the minimum and maximum rates further—for example a particular voice may not actually speak faster than 3 times normal even if you specify a value larger than 3.0.
* requiredEventTypes

  string[] optional

  The TTS event types the voice must support.
* voiceName

  string optional

  The name of the voice to use for synthesis. If empty, uses any available voice.
* volume

  number optional

  Speaking volume between 0 and 1 inclusive, with 0 being lowest and 1 being highest, with a default of 1.0.
* onEvent

  void optional

  This function is called with events that occur in the process of speaking the utterance.

  The `onEvent` function looks like:
  ```
  (event: [TtsEvent](#type-TtsEvent)) => {...}
  ```

  + event

    [TtsEvent](#type-TtsEvent)

    The update event from the text-to-speech engine indicating the status of this utterance.
### TtsVoice

* remote

  boolean optional

  If true, the synthesis engine is a remote network resource. It may be higher latency and may incur bandwidth costs.
* voiceName

  string optional

  The name of the voice.
### VoiceGender

Chrome 54+
Deprecated since Chrome 70

Gender is deprecated and is ignored.

  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### pause()

```
chrome.tts.pause()
```

Pauses speech synthesis, potentially in the middle of an utterance. A call to resume or stop will un-pause speech.

### resume()

# chrome.ttsEngine  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/ttsEngine/

# chrome.ttsEngine

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.ttsEngine` API to implement a text-to-speech(TTS) engine using an extension. If your extension registers using this API, it will receive events containing an utterance to be spoken and other parameters when any extension or Chrome App uses the [`tts`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tts/) API to generate speech. Your extension can then use any available web technology to synthesize and output the speech, and send events back to the calling function to report the status.

## Permissions

`ttsEngine`  
## Concepts and usage

An extension can register itself as a speech engine. By doing so, it can intercept some or all calls
to functions such as [`tts.speak()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts#method-speak) and [`tts.stop()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts#method-stop) and provide an alternate implementation.
Extensions are free to use any available web technology to provide speech, including streaming audio
from a server, HTML5 audio. An extension could even do something different
with the utterances, like display closed captions in a popup or send them as log messages to
a remote server.

To implement a TTS engine, an extension must declare the "ttsEngine" permission and then declare all
voices it provides in the extension manifest, like this:

```
{
  "name": "My TTS Engine",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["ttsEngine"],
  "tts_engine": {
    "voices": [
      {
        "voice_name": "Alice",
        "lang": "en-US",
        "event_types": ["start", "marker", "end"]
      },
      {
        "voice_name": "Pat",
        "lang": "en-US",
        "event_types": ["end"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "background": {
    "page": "background.html",
    "persistent": false
  }
}

```

An extension can specify any number of voices.

The `voice_name` parameter is required. The name should be descriptive enough that it identifies the
name of the voice and the engine used. In the unlikely event that two extensions register voices
with the same name, a client can specify the ID of the extension that should do the synthesis.

The `lang` parameter is optional, but highly recommended. Almost always, a voice can synthesize
speech in just a single language. When an engine supports more than one language, it can easily
register a separate voice for each language. Under rare circumstances where a single voice can
handle more than one language, it's easiest to just list two separate voices and handle them using
the same logic internally. However, if you want to create a voice that will handle utterances in any
language, leave out the `lang` parameter from your extension's manifest.

Finally, the `event_types` parameter is required if the engine can send events to update the client
on the progress of speech synthesis. At a minimum, supporting the `'end'` event type to indicate
when speech is finished is highly recommended, otherwise Chrome cannot schedule queued utterances.

Once loaded, an extension can replace the list of declared voices by calling
`chrome.ttsEngine.updateVoices`. (Note that the parameters used in the programatic call to
`updateVoices` are in camel case: e.g., `voiceName`, unlike the manifest file which uses
`voice_name`.)

The possible event types that you can send correspond to the event types that the `speak()` method
receives:

* `'start'`: The engine has started speaking the utterance.
* `'word'`: A word boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'sentence'`: A sentence boundary was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current
  speech position.
* `'marker'`: An SSML marker was reached. Use `event.charIndex` to determine the current speech
  position.
* `'end'`: The engine has finished speaking the utterance.
* `'error'`: An engine-specific error occurred and this utterance cannot be spoken. Pass more
  information in `event.errorMessage`.

The `'interrupted'` and `'cancelled'` events are not sent by the speech engine; they are generated
automatically by Chrome.

Text-to-speech clients can get the voice information from your extension's manifest by calling
[`tts.getVoices`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tts#method-getVoices), assuming you've registered speech event listeners as described below.

### Handle speech events

To generate speech at the request of clients, your extension must register listeners for both
`onSpeak` and `onStop`, like this:

```
const speakListener = (utterance, options, sendTtsEvent) => {
  sendTtsEvent({type: 'start', charIndex: 0})

  // (start speaking)

  sendTtsEvent({type: 'end', charIndex: utterance.length})
};

const stopListener = () => {
  // (stop all speech)
};

chrome.ttsEngine.onSpeak.addListener(speakListener);
chrome.ttsEngine.onStop.addListener(stopListener);

```

The decision of whether or not to send a given speech request to an extension is based solely on
whether the extension supports the given voice parameters in its manifest and has registered
listeners for `onSpeak` and `onStop`. In other words, there's no way for an extension to receive a
speech request and dynamically decide whether to handle it.

## Types

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
### onSpeak

```
chrome.ttsEngine.onSpeak.addListener(

# chrome.types

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

The `chrome.types` API contains type declarations for Chrome.

## Chrome settings

The [`ChromeSetting`](#type-ChromeSetting) type provides a common set of functions (`get()`, `set()`, and `clear()`)
as well as an event publisher (`onChange`) for settings of the Chrome browser. The [proxy settings
examples](/docs/extensions/reference/api/proxy#examples) demonstrate how these functions are intended to be used.

### Scope and lifecycle

Chrome distinguishes between three different scopes of browser settings:

`regular`
Settings set in the `regular` scope apply to regular browser windows and are inherited by incognito
windows if they are not overwritten. These settings are stored to disk and remain in place until
they are cleared by the governing extension, or the governing extension is disabled or uninstalled.
`incognito_persistent`
Settings set in the `incognito_persistent` scope apply only to incognito windows. For these, they
override `regular` settings. These settings are stored to disk and remain in place until they are
cleared by the governing extension, or the governing extension is disabled or uninstalled.
`incognito_session_only`
Settings set in the `incognito_session_only` scope apply only to incognito windows. For these, they
override `regular` and `incognito_persistent` settings. These settings are not stored to disk and
are cleared when the last incognito window is closed. They can only be set when at least one
incognito window is open.
### Precedence

Chrome manages settings on different layers. The following list describes the layers that may
influence the effective settings, in increasing order of precedence.

1. System settings provided by the operating system
2. Command-line parameters
3. Settings provided by extensions
4. Policies

As the list implies, policies might overrule any changes that you specify with your extension. You
can use the `get()` function to determine whether your extension is capable of providing a setting
or whether this setting would be overridden.

As discussed previously, Chrome allows using different settings for regular windows and incognito
windows. The following example illustrates the behavior. Assume that no policy overrides the
settings and that an extension can set settings for regular windows **(R)** and settings for
incognito windows **(I)**.

* If only **(R)** is set, these settings are effective for both regular and incognito windows.
* If only **(I)** is set, these settings are effective for only incognito windows. Regular windows
  use the settings determined by the lower layers (command-line options and system settings).
* If both **(R)** and **(I)** are set, the respective settings are used for regular and incognito
  windows.

If two or more extensions want to set the same setting to different values, the extension installed
most recently takes precedence over the other extensions. If the most recently installed extension
sets only **(I)**, the settings of regular windows can be defined by previously installed
extensions.

The *effective* value of a setting is the one that results from considering the precedence rules. It
is used by Chrome.

## Types

## Description

Use the `chrome.usb` API to interact with connected USB devices. This API provides access to USB operations from within the context of an app. Using this API, apps can function as drivers for hardware devices. Errors generated by this API are reported by setting [`runtime.lastError`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/runtime/#property-lastError) and executing the function's regular callback. The callback's regular parameters will be undefined in this case.

### resetDevice()

Promise

```
chrome.usb.resetDevice(  
  handle: [ConnectionHandle](#type-ConnectionHandle),  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Tries to reset the USB device. If the reset fails, the given connection handle will be closed and the USB device will appear to be disconnected then reconnected. In this case [`getDevices`](#method-getDevices) or [`findDevices`](#method-findDevices) must be called again to acquire the device.

#### Parameters

* handle

  [ConnectionHandle](#type-ConnectionHandle)

  A connection handle to reset.
* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (success: boolean) => void

    boolean
#### Returns

* Promise<boolean>

  Chrome 116+

  Promises are only supported for Manifest V3 and later, other platforms need to use callbacks.
### setConfiguration()

Promise

```
chrome.usb.setConfiguration(  
  handle: [ConnectionHandle](#type-ConnectionHandle),  
  configurationValue: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Select a device configuration.

This function effectively resets the device by selecting one of the device's available configurations. Only configuration values greater than `0` are valid however some buggy devices have a working configuration `0` and so this value is allowed.

#### Parameters

### setInterfaceAlternateSetting()

Promise

```
chrome.usb.setInterfaceAlternateSetting(  
  handle: [ConnectionHandle](#type-ConnectionHandle),  
  interfaceNumber: number,  
  alternateSetting: number,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Selects an alternate setting on a previously claimed interface.

#### Parameters

* handle

  [ConnectionHandle](#type-ConnectionHandle)

  An open connection to the device where this interface has been claimed.
* interfaceNumber

  number

# chrome.vpnProvider  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/vpnProvider/

# chrome.vpnProvider

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.vpnProvider` API to implement a VPN client.

## Permissions

`vpnProvider`  
## Availability

Chrome 43+
ChromeOS only

## Concepts and usage

Typical usage of `chrome.vpnProvider` is as follows:

* Create VPN configurations by calling [`createConfig()`](#method-createConfig). A VPN configuration is a persistent entry shown to the user in a ChromeOS UI. The user can select a VPN configuration from a list and connect to it or disconnect from it.
* Add listeners to the [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage), [`onPacketReceived`](#event-onPacketReceived), and [`onConfigRemoved`](#event-onConfigRemoved) events.
* When the user connects to the VPN configuration, [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage) will be received with the message `"connected"`. The period between the `"connected"` and `"disconnected"` messages is called a "VPN session". In this time period, the extension that receives the message is said to own the VPN session.
* Initiate connection to the VPN server and start the VPN client.
* Set the Parameters of the connection by calling [`setParameters()`](#method-setParameters).
* Notify the connection state as `"connected"` by calling [`notifyConnectionStateChanged()`](#method-notifyConnectionStateChanged).
* When the steps previous are completed without errors, a virtual tunnel is created to the network stack of ChromeOS. IP packets can be sent through the tunnel by calling [`sendPacket()`](#method-sendPacket) and any packets originating on the ChromeOS device will be received using the [`onPacketReceived`](#event-onPacketReceived) event handler.
* When the user disconnects from the VPN configuration, [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage) will be fired with the message `"disconnected"`.
* If the VPN configuration is no longer necessary, it can be destroyed by calling [`destroyConfig()`](#method-destroyConfig).

## Types

### Parameters

#### Properties

* address

  string

  IP address for the VPN interface in CIDR notation. IPv4 is currently the only supported mode.
* broadcastAddress

  string optional

  Broadcast address for the VPN interface. (default: deduced from IP address and mask)
* dnsServers

  string[]

  A list of IPs for the DNS servers.
* domainSearch

  string[] optional

  A list of search domains. (default: no search domain)
* exclusionList

  string[]

  Exclude network traffic to the list of IP blocks in CIDR notation from the tunnel. This can be used to bypass traffic to and from the VPN server. When many rules match a destination, the rule with the longest matching prefix wins. Entries that correspond to the same CIDR block are treated as duplicates. Such duplicates in the collated (exclusionList + inclusionList) list are eliminated and the exact duplicate entry that will be eliminated is undefined.
* inclusionList

  string[]

  Include network traffic to the list of IP blocks in CIDR notation to the tunnel. This parameter can be used to set up a split tunnel. By default no traffic is directed to the tunnel. Adding the entry "0.0.0.0/0" to this list gets all the user traffic redirected to the tunnel. When many rules match a destination, the rule with the longest matching prefix wins. Entries that correspond to the same CIDR block are treated as duplicates. Such duplicates in the collated (exclusionList + inclusionList) list are eliminated and the exact duplicate entry that will be eliminated is undefined.
* mtu

  string optional

  MTU setting for the VPN interface. (default: 1500 bytes)
* reconnect

  string optional

  Chrome 51+

  Whether or not the VPN extension implements auto-reconnection.

  If true, the `linkDown`, `linkUp`, `linkChanged`, `suspend`, and `resume` platform messages will be used to signal the respective events. If false, the system will forcibly disconnect the VPN if the network topology changes, and the user will need to reconnect manually. (default: false)

  This property is new in Chrome 51; it will generate an exception in earlier versions. try/catch can be used to conditionally enable the feature based on browser support.
### PlatformMessage

The enum is used by the platform to notify the client of the VPN session status.

#### Enum

"connected"   
 Indicates that the VPN configuration connected.

"disconnected"   
 Indicates that the VPN configuration disconnected.

"error"   
 Indicates that an error occurred in VPN connection, for example a timeout. A description of the error is given as the error argument to onPlatformMessage.

"linkDown"   
 Indicates that the default physical network connection is down.

"linkUp"   
 Indicates that the default physical network connection is back up.

"linkChanged"   
 Indicates that the default physical network connection changed, e.g. wifi->mobile.

"suspend"   
 Indicates that the OS is preparing to suspend, so the VPN should drop its connection. The extension is not guaranteed to receive this event prior to suspending.

"resume"   
 Indicates that the OS has resumed and the user has logged back in, so the VPN should try to reconnect.

### UIEvent

The enum is used by the platform to indicate the event that triggered `onUIEvent`.

#### Enum

"showAddDialog"   
 Requests that the VPN client show the add configuration dialog box to the user.

"showConfigureDialog"   
 Requests that the VPN client show the configuration settings dialog box to the user.

### VpnConnectionState

The enum is used by the VPN client to inform the platform of its current state. This helps provide meaningful messages to the user.

#### Enum

"connected"   
 Specifies that VPN connection was successful.

"failure"   
 Specifies that VPN connection has failed.

## Methods

### createConfig()

Promise

```
chrome.vpnProvider.createConfig(

# chrome.webNavigation  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation

# chrome.webNavigation

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.webNavigation` API to receive notifications about the status of navigation requests in-flight.

## Permissions

`webNavigation`  

All `chrome.webNavigation` methods and events require you to declare the `"webNavigation"` permission
in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "webNavigation"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Event order

For a navigation that is successfully completed, events are fired in the following order:

```
onBeforeNavigate -> onCommitted -> [onDOMContentLoaded] -> onCompleted

```

Any error that occurs during the process results in an `onErrorOccurred` event. For a specific
navigation, there are no further events fired after `onErrorOccurred`.

If a navigating frame contains subframes, its `onCommitted` is fired before any of its children's
`onBeforeNavigate`; while `onCompleted` is fired after all of its children's `onCompleted`.

If the reference fragment of a frame is changed, a `onReferenceFragmentUpdated` event is fired. This
event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`, even after `onCompleted`.

If the history API is used to modify the state of a frame (e.g. using `history.pushState()`, a
`onHistoryStateUpdated` event is fired. This event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`.

If a navigation restored a page from the [Back Forward Cache](https://web.dev/bfcache/), the `onDOMContentLoaded` event
won't fire. The event is not fired because the content has already completed load when the page
was first visited.

If a navigation was triggered using [Chrome Instant](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/177873) or [Instant Pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029), a completely loaded
page is swapped into the current tab. In that case, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired.

### Relation to webRequest events

There is no defined ordering between events of the [webRequest API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest) and the events of the
webNavigation API. It is possible that webRequest events are still received for frames that already
started a new navigation, or that a navigation only proceeds after the network resources are already
fully loaded.

In general, the webNavigation events are closely related to the navigation state that is displayed
in the UI, while the webRequest events correspond to the state of the network stack which is
generally opaque to the user.

### Tab IDs

Not all navigating tabs correspond to actual tabs in Chrome's UI, for example, a tab that is being
pre-rendered. Such tabs are not accessible using the [tabs API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs) nor can you request information
about them by calling `webNavigation.getFrame()` or `webNavigation.getAllFrames()`. Once such a tab
is swapped in, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired and they become accessible through these APIs.

### Timestamps

It's important to note that some technical oddities in the OS's handling of distinct Chrome
processes can cause the clock to be skewed between the browser itself and extension processes. That
means that the `timeStamp` property of the `WebNavigation` event `timeStamp` property is only guaranteed
to be *internally* consistent. Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct offset
between them, but comparing them to the current time inside the extension (using `(new Date()).getTime()`,
for instance) might give unexpected results.

### Frame IDs

Frames within a tab can be identified by a frame ID. The frame ID of the main frame is always 0, the
ID of child frames is a positive number. Once a document is constructed in a frame, its frame ID
remains constant during the lifetime of the document. As of Chrome 49, this ID is also constant for
the lifetime of the frame (across multiple navigations).

Due to the multi-process nature of Chrome, a tab might use different processes to render the source
and destination of a web page. Therefore, if a navigation takes place in a new process, you might
receive events both from the new and the old page until the new navigation is committed (i.e. the
`onCommitted` event is sent for the new main frame). In other words, it is possible to have more
than one pending sequence of webNavigation events with the same `frameId`. The sequences can be
distinguished by the `processId` key.

Also note that during a provisional load the process might be switched several times. This happens
when the load is redirected to a different site. In this case, you will receive repeated
`onBeforeNavigate` and `onErrorOccurred` events, until you receive the final `onCommitted` event.

Another concept that is problematic with extensions is the lifecycle of the
frame. A frame hosts a document (which is associated with a committed URL).
The document can change (say by navigating) but the *frameId* won't, and so it
is difficult to associate that something happened in a specific document with
just *frameIds*. We are introducing a concept of a [documentId](/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation#method-getFrame:%7E:text=retrieve%20information%20about.-,documentId,-string%C2%A0optional)
which is a unique identifier per document. If a frame is navigated and opens a
new document the identifier will change. This field is useful for determining
when pages change their lifecycle state (between prerender/active/cached)
because it remains the same.

### Transition types and qualifiers

The `webNavigation` `onCommitted` event has a `transitionType` and a `transitionQualifiers`
property. The *transition type* is the same as used in the [history API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/history#transition_types) describing how the
browser navigated to this particular URL. In addition, several *transition qualifiers* can be
returned that further define the navigation.

The following transition qualifiers exist:

| Transition qualifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "client\_redirect" | One or more redirects caused by JavaScript or meta refresh tags on the page happened during the navigation. |
| "server\_redirect" | One or more redirects caused by HTTP headers sent from the server happened during the navigation. |
| "forward\_back" | The user used the Forward or Back button to initiate the navigation. |
| "from\_address\_bar" | The user initiated the navigation from the address bar (aka Omnibox). |

## Examples

To try this API, install the [webNavigation API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/webNavigation) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

      True if the last navigation in this frame was interrupted by an error, i.e. the onErrorOccurred event fired.
    - frameType

      [FrameType](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/extensionTypes/#type-FrameType)

      Chrome 106+

      The type of frame the navigation occurred in.
    - parentDocumentId

      string optional

      Chrome 106+

      A UUID of the parent document owning this frame. This is not set if there is no parent.
    - parentFrameId

      number

      The ID of the parent frame, or `-1` if this is the main frame.
    - url

      string

      The URL currently associated with this frame, if the frame identified by the frameId existed at one point in the given tab. The fact that an URL is associated with a given frameId does not imply that the corresponding frame still exists.
#### Returns

* Promise<object | undefined>

  Chrome 93+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

# chrome.webNavigation  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation/

# chrome.webNavigation

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.webNavigation` API to receive notifications about the status of navigation requests in-flight.

## Permissions

`webNavigation`  

All `chrome.webNavigation` methods and events require you to declare the `"webNavigation"` permission
in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "webNavigation"
  ],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### Event order

For a navigation that is successfully completed, events are fired in the following order:

```
onBeforeNavigate -> onCommitted -> [onDOMContentLoaded] -> onCompleted

```

Any error that occurs during the process results in an `onErrorOccurred` event. For a specific
navigation, there are no further events fired after `onErrorOccurred`.

If a navigating frame contains subframes, its `onCommitted` is fired before any of its children's
`onBeforeNavigate`; while `onCompleted` is fired after all of its children's `onCompleted`.

If the reference fragment of a frame is changed, a `onReferenceFragmentUpdated` event is fired. This
event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`, even after `onCompleted`.

If the history API is used to modify the state of a frame (e.g. using `history.pushState()`, a
`onHistoryStateUpdated` event is fired. This event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`.

If a navigation restored a page from the [Back Forward Cache](https://web.dev/bfcache/), the `onDOMContentLoaded` event
won't fire. The event is not fired because the content has already completed load when the page
was first visited.

If a navigation was triggered using [Chrome Instant](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/177873) or [Instant Pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029), a completely loaded
page is swapped into the current tab. In that case, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired.

### Relation to webRequest events

There is no defined ordering between events of the [webRequest API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest) and the events of the
webNavigation API. It is possible that webRequest events are still received for frames that already
started a new navigation, or that a navigation only proceeds after the network resources are already
fully loaded.

In general, the webNavigation events are closely related to the navigation state that is displayed
in the UI, while the webRequest events correspond to the state of the network stack which is
generally opaque to the user.

### Tab IDs

Not all navigating tabs correspond to actual tabs in Chrome's UI, for example, a tab that is being
pre-rendered. Such tabs are not accessible using the [tabs API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs) nor can you request information
about them by calling `webNavigation.getFrame()` or `webNavigation.getAllFrames()`. Once such a tab
is swapped in, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired and they become accessible through these APIs.

### Timestamps

It's important to note that some technical oddities in the OS's handling of distinct Chrome
processes can cause the clock to be skewed between the browser itself and extension processes. That
means that the `timeStamp` property of the `WebNavigation` event `timeStamp` property is only guaranteed
to be *internally* consistent. Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct offset
between them, but comparing them to the current time inside the extension (using `(new Date()).getTime()`,
for instance) might give unexpected results.

### Frame IDs

Frames within a tab can be identified by a frame ID. The frame ID of the main frame is always 0, the
ID of child frames is a positive number. Once a document is constructed in a frame, its frame ID
remains constant during the lifetime of the document. As of Chrome 49, this ID is also constant for
the lifetime of the frame (across multiple navigations).

Due to the multi-process nature of Chrome, a tab might use different processes to render the source
and destination of a web page. Therefore, if a navigation takes place in a new process, you might
receive events both from the new and the old page until the new navigation is committed (i.e. the
`onCommitted` event is sent for the new main frame). In other words, it is possible to have more
than one pending sequence of webNavigation events with the same `frameId`. The sequences can be
distinguished by the `processId` key.

Also note that during a provisional load the process might be switched several times. This happens
when the load is redirected to a different site. In this case, you will receive repeated
`onBeforeNavigate` and `onErrorOccurred` events, until you receive the final `onCommitted` event.

Another concept that is problematic with extensions is the lifecycle of the
frame. A frame hosts a document (which is associated with a committed URL).
The document can change (say by navigating) but the *frameId* won't, and so it
is difficult to associate that something happened in a specific document with
just *frameIds*. We are introducing a concept of a [documentId](/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation#method-getFrame:%7E:text=retrieve%20information%20about.-,documentId,-string%C2%A0optional)
which is a unique identifier per document. If a frame is navigated and opens a
new document the identifier will change. This field is useful for determining
when pages change their lifecycle state (between prerender/active/cached)
because it remains the same.

### Transition types and qualifiers

The `webNavigation` `onCommitted` event has a `transitionType` and a `transitionQualifiers`
property. The *transition type* is the same as used in the [history API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/history#transition_types) describing how the
browser navigated to this particular URL. In addition, several *transition qualifiers* can be
returned that further define the navigation.

The following transition qualifiers exist:

| Transition qualifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "client\_redirect" | One or more redirects caused by JavaScript or meta refresh tags on the page happened during the navigation. |
| "server\_redirect" | One or more redirects caused by HTTP headers sent from the server happened during the navigation. |
| "forward\_back" | The user used the Forward or Back button to initiate the navigation. |
| "from\_address\_bar" | The user initiated the navigation from the address bar (aka Omnibox). |

## Examples

To try this API, install the [webNavigation API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/webNavigation) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
### getFrame()

Promise

```
chrome.webNavigation.getFrame(  
  details: object,  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Retrieves information about the given frame. A frame refers to an <iframe> or a <frame> of a web page and is identified by a tab ID and a frame ID.

#### Parameters

* details

  object

  Information about the frame to retrieve information about.

  + documentId

    string optional

    number optional

    The ID of the frame in the given tab.
  + processId

    number optional

    Deprecated since Chrome 49

    - url

      string

      The URL currently associated with this frame, if the frame identified by the frameId existed at one point in the given tab. The fact that an URL is associated with a given frameId does not imply that the corresponding frame still exists.
#### Returns

* Promise<object | undefined>

  Chrome 93+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The

# chrome.webRequest  |  API  |  Chrome for Developers

URL: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest

# chrome.webRequest

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.webRequest` API to observe and analyze traffic and to intercept, block, or modify requests in-flight.

## Permissions

`webRequest`  

You must declare the `"webRequest"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use the web request
API, along with the necessary [host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions). To intercept a sub-resource request, the
extension must have access to both the requested URL and its initiator. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "webRequest"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.google.com/*"
  ],
  ...
}

```

`webRequestBlocking`

Required to register blocking event handlers. As of Manifest V3, this is only
available to policy installed extensions.

`webRequestAuthProvider`

Required to use the [`onAuthRequired`](#event-onAuthRequired) method. See
[Handling authentication](#handle-auth).

## Concepts and usage

### Life cycle of requests

The web request API defines a set of events that follow the life cycle of a web request. You can use
these events to observe and analyze traffic. Certain synchronous events will allow you to intercept,
block, or modify a request.

The event life cycle for successful requests is illustrated here, followed by event definitions:

`onBeforeRequest` (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request is about to occur. This event is sent before any TCP connection is made and can
be used to cancel or redirect requests.
`onBeforeSendHeaders` (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request is about to occur and the initial headers have been prepared. The event is
intended to allow extensions to add, modify, and delete request headers [(\*)](#life_cycle_footnote). The
`onBeforeSendHeaders` event is passed to all subscribers, so different subscribers may attempt to
modify the request; see the [Implementation details](#implementation-details) section for how this is handled. This event
can be used to cancel the request.
`onSendHeaders`
Fires after all extensions have had a chance to modify the request headers, and presents the final
[(\*)](#life_cycle_footnote) version. The event is triggered before the headers are sent to the network. This event is
informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow modifying or cancelling the request.
`onHeadersReceived` (optionally synchronous)
Fires each time that an HTTP(S) response header is received. Due to redirects and authentication
requests this can happen multiple times per request. This event is intended to allow extensions to
add, modify, and delete response headers, such as incoming Content-Type headers. The caching
directives are processed before this event is triggered, so modifying headers such as Cache-Control
has no influence on the browser's cache. It also allows you to cancel or redirect the request.
`onAuthRequired` (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request requires authentication of the user. This event can be handled synchronously to
provide authentication credentials. Note that extensions may provide invalid credentials. Take care
not to enter an infinite loop by repeatedly providing invalid credentials. This can also be used to
cancel the request.
`onBeforeRedirect`
Fires when a redirect is about to be executed. A redirection can be triggered by an HTTP response
code or by an extension. This event is informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow
you to modify or cancel the request.
`onResponseStarted`
Fires when the first byte of the response body is received. For HTTP requests, this means that the
status line and response headers are available. This event is informational and handled
asynchronously. It does not allow modifying or canceling the request.
`onCompleted`
Fires when a request has been processed successfully.
`onErrorOccurred`
Fires when a request could not be processed successfully.

The web request API guarantees that for each request, either `onCompleted` or `onErrorOccurred` is
fired as the final event with one exception: If a request is redirected to a `data://` URL,
`onBeforeRedirect` is the last reported event.

\*
Note that the web request API presents an abstraction of the network stack to the extension.
Internally, one URL request can be split into several HTTP requests (for example, to fetch individual
byte ranges from a large file) or can be handled by the network stack without communicating with the
network. For this reason, the API does not provide the final HTTP headers that are sent to the
network. For example, all headers that are related to caching are invisible to the extension.

The following headers are currently **not provided** to the `onBeforeSendHeaders` event. This list
is not guaranteed to be complete or stable.

* Authorization
* Cache-Control
* Connection
* Content-Length
* Host
* If-Modified-Since
* If-None-Match
* If-Range
* Partial-Data
* Pragma
* Proxy-Authorization
* Proxy-Connection
* Transfer-Encoding

Starting from Chrome 79, request header modifications affect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
checks. If modified headers for cross-origin requests do not meet the criteria, it will result in
sending a CORS preflight to ask the server if such headers can be accepted. If you really need to
modify headers in a way to violate the CORS protocol, you need to specify `'extraHeaders'` in
`opt_extraInfoSpec`. On the other hand, response header modifications do not work to deceive CORS
checks. If you need to deceive the CORS protocol, you also need to specify `'extraHeaders'` for the
response modifications.

Starting from Chrome 79, the webRequest API **does not** intercept CORS preflight requests and
responses by default. A CORS preflight for a request URL is visible to an extension if there is a
listener with `'extraHeaders'` specified in `opt_extraInfoSpec` for the request URL.
`onBeforeRequest` can also take `'extraHeaders'` from Chrome 79.

Starting from Chrome 79, the following request header is **not provided** and cannot be modified or
removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`:

* Origin

Starting from Chrome 72, if you need to modify responses before [Cross Origin Read Blocking
(CORB)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/services/network/cross_origin_read_blocking_explainer.md) can block the response, you need to specify `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`.

Starting from Chrome 72, the following request headers are **not provided** and cannot be modified
or removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`:

* Accept-Language
* Accept-Encoding
* Referer
* Cookie

Starting from Chrome 72, the `Set-Cookie` response header is **not provided** and cannot be modified
or removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`.

Starting from Chrome 89, the `X-Frame-Options` response header cannot be effectively modified
or removed without specifying `'extraHeaders'` in `opt_extraInfoSpec`.

The webRequest API only exposes requests that the extension has permission to see, given its [host
permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions). Moreover, only the following schemes are accessible: `http://`, `https://`,
`ftp://`, `file://`, `ws://` (since Chrome 58), `wss://` (since Chrome 58), `urn:` (since Chrome 91), or
`chrome-extension://`. In addition, even certain requests with URLs using one of the above schemes
are hidden. These include `chrome-extension://other_extension_id` where `other_extension_id` is not
the ID of the extension to handle the request, `https://www.google.com/chrome`, and other sensitive
requests core to browser functionality. Also synchronous XMLHttpRequests from your extension are
hidden from blocking event handlers in order to prevent deadlocks. Note that for some of the
supported schemes the set of available events might be limited due to the nature of the
corresponding protocol. For example, for the file: scheme, only `onBeforeRequest`,
`onResponseStarted`, `onCompleted`, and `onErrorOccurred` may be dispatched.

Starting from Chrome 58, the webRequest API supports intercepting the WebSocket handshake request.
Since the handshake is done by means of an HTTP upgrade request, its flow fits into HTTP-oriented
webRequest model. Note that the API does **not intercept**:

* Individual messages sent over an established WebSocket connection.
* WebSocket closing connection.

Redirects are **not supported** for WebSocket requests.

Starting from Chrome 72, an extension will be able to intercept a request only if it has host
permissions to both the requested URL and the request initiator.

Starting from Chrome 96, the webRequest API supports intercepting the WebTransport over HTTP/3
handshake request. Since the handshake is done by means of an HTTP CONNECT request, its flow fits
into HTTP-oriented webRequest model. Note that:

* Once the session is established, extensions cannot observe or intervene in the session via the
  webRequest API.
* Modifying HTTP request headers in `onBeforeSendHeaders` is ignored.
* Redirects and authentications are **not supported** in WebTransport over HTTP/3.

### Request IDs

Each request is identified by a request ID. This ID is unique within a browser session and the
context of an extension. It remains constant during the life cycle of a request and can be used
to match events for the same request. Note that several HTTP requests are mapped to one web request
in case of HTTP redirection or HTTP authentication.

### Registering event listeners

To register an event listener for a web request, you use a variation on the [usual `addListener()`
function](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events). In addition to specifying a callback function, you have to specify a filter argument, and you may specify an optional extra info argument.

The three arguments to the web request API's `addListener()` have the following definitions:

```
var callback = function(details) {...};
var filter = {...};
var opt_extraInfoSpec = [...];

```

Here's an example of listening for the `onBeforeRequest` event:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
    callback, filter, opt_extraInfoSpec);

```

Each `addListener()` call takes a mandatory callback function as the first parameter. This callback
function is passed a dictionary containing information about the current URL request. The
information in this dictionary depends on the specific event type as well as the content of
`opt_extraInfoSpec`.

If the optional `opt_extraInfoSpec` array contains the string `'blocking'` (only allowed for
specific events), the callback function is handled synchronously. That means that the request is
blocked until the callback function returns. In this case, the callback can return a
[`webRequest.BlockingResponse`](#type-BlockingResponse) that determines the further life cycle of the request. Depending
on the context, this response allows canceling or redirecting a request (`onBeforeRequest`),
canceling a request or modifying headers (`onBeforeSendHeaders`, `onHeadersReceived`), and
canceling a request or providing authentication credentials (`onAuthRequired`).

If the optional `opt_extraInfoSpec` array contains the string `'asyncBlocking'` instead (only
allowed for `onAuthRequired`), the extension can generate the [`webRequest.BlockingResponse`](#type-BlockingResponse)
asynchronously.

The [`webRequest.RequestFilter`](#type-RequestFilter) `filter` allows limiting the requests for which events are
triggered in various dimensions:

URLs
[URL patterns](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/match-patterns) such as `*://www.google.com/foo*bar`.
Types
Request types such as `main_frame` (a document that is loaded for a top-level frame), `sub_frame` (a
document that is loaded for an embedded frame), and `image` (an image on a web site). See
[`webRequest.RequestFilter`](#type-RequestFilter).
Tab ID
The identifier for one tab.
Window ID
The identifier for a window.

Depending on the event type, you can specify strings in `opt_extraInfoSpec` to ask for additional
information about the request. This is used to provide detailed information on request's data only
if explicitly requested.

### Handling authentication

To handle requests for HTTP authentication, add the `"webRequestAuthProvider"`
permission to your manifest file:

```
{
  "permissions": [
    "webRequest",
    "webRequestAuthProvider"
  ]
}

```

Note that this permission is not required for a policy installed extension with
the `"webRequestBlocking"` permission.

To provide credentials synchronously:

```
chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener((details) => {
    return {
      authCredentials: {
        username: 'guest',
        password: 'guest'
      }
    };
  },
  { urls: ['https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/guest/guest'] },
  ['blocking']
);

```

To provide credentials asynchronously:

```
chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener((details, callback) => {
    callback({
      authCredentials: {
        username: 'guest',
        password: 'guest'
      }
    });
  },
  { urls: ['https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/guest/guest'] },
  ['asyncBlocking']
);

```
### Implementation details

Several implementation details can be important to understand when developing an extension that uses
the web request API:

#### web\_accessible\_resources

When an extension uses webRequest APIs to redirect a public resource request to a resource that is not web accessible, it is blocked and will result in an error. The above holds true even if the resource that is not web accessible is owned by the redirecting extension. To declare resources for use with declarativeWebRequest APIs, the `"web_accessible_resources"` array must be declared and populated in the manifest as documented [here](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources).

#### Conflict resolution

In the current implementation of the web request API, a request is considered canceled if at
least one extension instructs to cancel the request. If an extension cancels a request, all
extensions are notified by an `onErrorOccurred` event. Only one extension can redirect a
request or modify a header at a time. If more than one extension attempts to modify the request, the
most recently installed extension wins, and all others are ignored. An extension is not notified if
its instruction to modify or redirect has been ignored.

#### Caching

Chrome employs two caches—an on-disk cache and a very fast in-memory cache. The lifetime of an
in-memory cache is attached to the lifetime of a render process, which roughly corresponds to a tab.
Requests that are answered from the in-memory cache are invisible to the web request API. If a
request handler changes its behavior (for example, the behavior according to which requests are
blocked), a simple page refresh might not respect this changed behavior. To ensure the behavior
change goes through, call `handlerBehaviorChanged()` to flush the in-memory cache. But don't do it
often; flushing the cache is a very expensive operation. You don't need to call
`handlerBehaviorChanged()` after registering or unregistering an event listener.

#### Timestamps

The `timestamp` property of web request events is only guaranteed to be *internally* consistent.
Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct offset between them, but comparing
them to the current time inside the extension (via `(new Date()).getTime()`, for instance) might
give unexpected results.

#### Error handling

If you try to register an event with invalid arguments, then a JavaScript error will be thrown, and
the event handler will not be registered. If an error is thrown while an event is handled or if an
event handler returns an invalid blocking response, an error message is logged to your extension's
console, and the handler is ignored for that request.

## Examples

The following example illustrates how to block all requests to `www.evil.com`:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) {
    return {cancel: details.url.indexOf("://www.evil.com/") != -1};
  },
  {urls: ["<all_urls>"]},
  ["blocking"]
);

```

As this function uses a blocking event handler, it requires the `"webRequest"` as well as the
`"webRequestBlocking"` permission in the manifest file.

The following example achieves the same goal in a more efficient way because requests that are not
targeted to `www.evil.com` do not need to be passed to the extension:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) { return {cancel: true}; },
  {urls: ["*://www.evil.com/*"]},
  ["blocking"]
);

```

The following example illustrates how to delete the User-Agent header from all requests:

```
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders.addListener(
  function(details) {
    for (var i = 0; i < details.requestHeaders.length; ++i) {
      if (details.requestHeaders[i].name === 'User-Agent') {
        details.requestHeaders.splice(i, 1);
        break;
      }
    }
    return {requestHeaders: details.requestHeaders};
  },
  {urls: ["<all_urls>"]},
  ["blocking", "requestHeaders"]
);

```

To try the `chrome.webRequest` API,
install the [webRequest sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/webRequest/) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples)
repository.

## Types

### BlockingResponse

Returns value for event handlers that have the 'blocking' extraInfoSpec applied. Allows the event handler to modify network requests.

#### Properties

* authCredentials

  object optional

  Only used as a response to the onAuthRequired event. If set, the request is made using the supplied credentials.

  + password

    string
  + username

    string
* cancel

  boolean optional

  If true, the request is cancelled. This prevents the request from being sent. This can be used as a response to the onBeforeRequest, onBeforeSendHeaders, onHeadersReceived and onAuthRequired events.
* redirectUrl

  string optional

  Only used as a response to the onBeforeRequest and onHeadersReceived events. If set, the original request is prevented from being sent/completed and is instead redirected to the given URL. Redirections to non-HTTP schemes such as `data:` are allowed. Redirects initiated by a redirect action use the original request method for the redirect, with one exception: If the redirect is initiated at the onHeadersReceived stage, then the redirect will be issued using the GET method. Redirects from URLs with `ws://` and `wss://` schemes are **ignored**.
* requestHeaders

  [HttpHeaders](#type-HttpHeaders) optional

  Only used as a response to the onBeforeSendHeaders event. If set, the request is made with these request headers instead.
* responseHeaders

  [HttpHeaders](#type-HttpHeaders) optional

  Only used as a response to the onHeadersReceived event. If set, the server is assumed to have responded with these response headers instead. Only return `responseHeaders` if you really want to modify the headers in order to limit the number of conflicts (only one extension may modify `responseHeaders` for each request).
### FormDataItem

Chrome 66+

### MAX\_HANDLER\_BEHAVIOR\_CHANGED\_CALLS\_PER\_10\_MINUTES

The maximum number of times that `handlerBehaviorChanged` can be called per 10 minute sustained interval. `handlerBehaviorChanged` is an expensive function call that shouldn't be called often.

#### Value

20   

## Methods

### handlerBehaviorChanged()

Promise

```
chrome.webRequest.handlerBehaviorChanged(  
  callback?: function,  
)
```

Needs to be called when the behavior of the webRequest handlers has changed to prevent incorrect handling due to caching. This function call is expensive. Don't call it often.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function optional

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  () => void
  ```
#### Returns

* Promise<void>

  Chrome 116+

  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
  backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
  promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
## Events

### onActionIgnored

Chrome 70+

```
chrome.webRequest.onActionIgnored.addListener(  
  callback: function,  
)
```

Fired when an extension's proposed modification to a network request is ignored. This happens in case of conflicts with other extensions.

#### Parameters

* callback

  function

  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  ```
  (details: object) => void
  ```

  + details

    object

    - action

      [IgnoredActionType](#type-IgnoredActionType)

      The proposed action which was ignored.
    - requestId

      string

      The ID of the request. Request IDs are unique within a browser session. As a result, they could be used to relate different events of the same request.

)
```

Fired when an authentication failure is received. The listener has three options: it can provide authentication credentials, it can cancel the request and display the error page, or it can take no action on the challenge. If bad user credentials are provided, this may be called multiple times for the same request. Note, only one of `'blocking'` or `'asyncBlocking'` modes must be specified in the `extraInfoSpec` parameter.

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Description

Use the `chrome.windows` API to interact with browser windows. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange windows in the browser.

## Permissions

When requested, a [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) contains an array of [`tabs.Tab`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab) objects. You must
declare the `"tabs"` permission in your [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#manifest) if you need access to the [`url`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-url),
[`pendingUrl`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-pendingUrl), [`title`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-title), or [`favIconUrl`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-favIconUrl) properties of [`tabs.Tab`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": ["tabs"],
  ...
}

```
## Concepts and usage

### The current window

Many functions in the extension system take an optional `windowId` argument, which defaults to the
current window.

The *current window* is the window that contains the code that is currently executing. It's
important to realize that this can be different from the topmost or focused window.

For example, say an extension creates a few tabs or windows from a single HTML file, and that the
HTML file contains a call to [`tabs.query()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#method-query). The current window is the window that contains the
page that made the call, no matter what the topmost window is.

In the case of [service workers](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers), the value of the current window falls back to the last active
window. Under some circumstances, there may be no current window for background pages.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [windows API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/windows) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples)
repository.

## Types

### CreateType

Chrome 44+

Specifies what type of browser window to create. 'panel' is deprecated and is available only to existing allowlisted extensions on Chrome OS.

#### Enum

"normal"   
 Specifies the window as a standard window.

"popup"   
 Specifies the window as a popup window.

"panel"   
 Specifies the window as a panel.

### QueryOptions

Chrome 88+

#### Properties

* populate

  boolean optional

  If true, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) object has a `tabs` property that contains a list of the [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab) objects. The `Tab` objects only contain the `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and `favIconUrl` properties if the extension's manifest file includes the `"tabs"` permission.
* windowTypes

  [WindowType](#type-WindowType)[] optional

  If set, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) returned is filtered based on its type. If unset, the default filter is set to `['normal', 'popup']`.
### Window

#### Properties

* alwaysOnTop

  boolean

  Whether the window is set to be always on top.
* focused

  boolean

  Whether the window is currently the focused window.
* height

  number optional

  The height of the window, including the frame, in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `height` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
* id

  number optional

  The ID of the window. Window IDs are unique within a browser session. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned an `ID` property; for example, when querying windows using the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API, in which case a session ID may be present.
* incognito

  boolean

  Whether the window is incognito.
* left

  number optional

  The offset of the window from the left edge of the screen in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `left` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
* sessionId

  string optional

  The session ID used to uniquely identify a window, obtained from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
* state

  [WindowState](#type-WindowState) optional

  The state of this browser window.
* tabs

  [Tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab)[] optional

  Array of [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab) objects representing the current tabs in the window.
* top

  number optional

  The offset of the window from the top edge of the screen in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `top` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
* type

  [WindowType](#type-WindowType) optional

  The type of browser window this is.
* width

  number optional

  The width of the window, including the frame, in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `width` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
### WindowState

Chrome 44+

The state of this browser window. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `state` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

"locked-fullscreen"   
 Locked fullscreen window state. This fullscreen state cannot be exited by user action and is available only to allowlisted extensions on Chrome OS.

### WindowType

Chrome 44+
