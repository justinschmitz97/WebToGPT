Answering a question for a fellow Vue user on Discord or the forum is also considered a valuable contribution. Triaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue. We receive many issues inour repositories on GitHubevery single day. Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work. You don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time. Contributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make. The Vue core repository provides acontributing guide, which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Other sub-project repositories may also contain its own contribution guide - please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests. Bug fixes are welcome at any time. For new features, it is best to discuss the use case and implementation details first in theRFC repo. Apart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:"

During rerender, the value of our customRef is reevaluated, returning a new object datatype as a prop to a child component. This prop is compared with its last value in the child component, and since they are different, the reactive dependencies of the customRef are triggered in the child component. Meanwhile, the reactive dependencies in the parent component do not run because the customRef's setter was not called, and its dependencies were not triggered as a result.See it in the Playground"

This can lead toidentity hazards- i.e. performing an operation that relies on object identity but using both the raw and the proxied version of the same object:jsconstfoo=markRaw({nested: {}})constbar=reactive({// although `foo` is marked as raw, foo.nested is not.nested: foo.nested})console.log(foo.nested===bar.nested)// falseIdentity hazards are in general rare.

In fact, the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API! The fundamental concepts and knowledge about Vue are shared across the two styles. The Options API is centered around the concept of a \"component instance\" (thisas seen in the example), which typically aligns better with a class-based mental model for users coming from OOP language backgrounds. It is also more beginner-friendly by abstracting away the reactivity details and enforcing code organization via option groups. The Composition API is centered around declaring reactive state variables directly in a function scope and composing state from multiple functions together to handle complexity. It is more free-form and requires an understanding of how reactivity works in Vue to be used effectively. In return, its flexibility enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic. You can learn more about the comparison between the two styles and the potential benefits of Composition API in theComposition API FAQ. If you are new to Vue, here's our general recommendation:"

Here, we will primarily focus on techniques that are specific to Vue. If your use case is sensitive to page load performance, avoid shipping it as a pure client-side SPA. You want your server to be directly sending HTML containing the content the users want to see. Pure client-side rendering suffers from slow time-to-content. This can be mitigated withServer-Side Rendering (SSR)orStatic Site Generation (SSG). Check out theSSR Guideto learn about performing SSR with Vue. If your app doesn't have rich interactivity requirements, you can also use a traditional backend server to render the HTML and enhance it with Vue on the client. If your main application has to be an SPA, but has marketing pages (landing, about, blog), ship them separately! Your marketing pages should ideally be deployed as static HTML with minimal JS, by using SSG. One of the most effective ways to improve page load performance is shipping smaller JavaScript bundles.

The following tips affect both page load and update performance. One of the most common performance issues in all frontend applications is rendering large lists. No matter how performant a framework is, rendering a list with thousands of itemswillbe slow due to the sheer number of DOM nodes that the browser needs to handle. However, we don't necessarily have to render all these nodes upfront. In most cases, the user's screen size can display only a small subset of our large list. We can greatly improve the performance withlist virtualization, the technique of only rendering the items that are currently in or close to the viewport in a large list.

This typically becomes noticeable when dealing with large arrays of deeply nested objects, where a single render needs to access 100,000+ properties, so it should only affect very specific use cases. Vue does provide an escape hatch to opt-out of deep reactivity by usingshallowRef()andshallowReactive(). Shallow APIs create state that is reactive only at the root level, and exposes all nested objects untouched. This keeps nested property access fast, with the trade-off being that we must now treat all nested objects as immutable, and updates can only be triggered by replacing the root state:"

Note that reducing only a few instances won't have noticeable effect, so don't sweat it if the component is rendered only a few times in the app. The best scenario to consider this optimization is again in large lists. Imagine a list of 100 items where each item component contains many child components.

Similar to prop type validation, an emitted event can be validated if it is defined with the object syntax instead of the array syntax.

The main drawback of such mutations is that it allows the child component to affect parent state in a way that isn't obvious to the parent component, potentially making it more difficult to reason about the data flow in the future. As a best practice, you should avoid such mutations unless the parent and child are tightly coupled by design. In most cases, the child shouldemit an eventto let the parent perform the mutation. Components can specify requirements for their props, such as the types you've already seen. If a requirement is not met, Vue will warn you in the browser's JavaScript console.

With only props, we would have to pass the same prop across the entire parent chain:  Notice although the<Footer>component may not care about these props at all, it still needs to declare and pass them along just so<DeepChild>can access them. If there is a longer parent chain, more components would be affected along the way. This is called \"props drilling\" and definitely isn't fun to deal with.

Later in the guide we will discuss how we can perform side effects in reaction to state changes withwatchers. The returned value from a computed property is derived state. Think of it as a temporary snapshot - every time the source state changes, a new snapshot is created. It does not make sense to mutate a snapshot, so a computed return value should be treated as read-only and never be mutated - instead, update the source state it depends on to trigger new computations.

In comparison,v-showis much simpler - the element is always rendered regardless of initial condition, with CSS-based toggling. Generally speaking,v-ifhas higher toggle costs whilev-showhas higher initial render costs. So preferv-showif you need to toggle something very often, and preferv-ifif the condition is unlikely to change at runtime. Note It'snotrecommended to usev-ifandv-foron the same element due to implicit precedence. Refer tostyle guidefor details. Whenv-ifandv-forare both used on the same element,v-ifwill be evaluated first. See thelist rendering guidefor details. Edit this page on GitHub"

Think of the template as a JavaScript function declared in the same scope - it naturally has access to everything declared alongside it. TIP For the rest of the guide, we will be primarily using SFC +<script setup>syntax for the Composition API code examples, as that is the most common usage for Vue developers. If you are not using SFC, you can still use Composition API with thesetup()option. You might be wondering why we need refs with the.valueinstead of plain variables. To explain that, we will need to briefly discuss how Vue's reactivity system works. When you use a ref in a template, and change the ref's value later, Vue automatically detects the change and updates the DOM accordingly. This is made possible with a dependency-tracking based reactivity system. When a component is rendered for the first time, Vuetracksevery ref that was used during the render. Later on, when a ref is mutated, it willtriggera re-render for components that are tracking it. In standard JavaScript, there is no way to detect the access or mutation of plain variables. However, we can intercept the get and set operations of an object's properties using getter and setter methods. The.valueproperty gives Vue the opportunity to detect when a ref has been accessed or mutated. Under the hood, Vue performs the tracking in its getter, and performs triggering in its setter. Conceptually, you can think of a ref as an object that looks like this:"

Combined with the reactivity system, Vue can intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes. If you are familiar with Virtual DOM concepts and prefer the raw power of JavaScript, you can alsodirectly write render functionsinstead of templates, with optional JSX support. However, do note that they do not enjoy the same level of compile-time optimizations as templates.

Similar to component updates, user-created watcher callbacks are batched to avoid duplicate invocations.

By default, a watcher's callback is calledafterparent component updates (if any), andbeforethe owner component's DOM updates.

                    "text": "Despite an API style based on function composition,Composition API is NOT functional programming. Composition API is based on Vue's mutable, fine-grained reactivity paradigm, whereas functional programming emphasizes immutability. If you are interested in learning how to use Vue with Composition API, you can set the site-wide API preference to Composition API using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar, and then go through the guide from the beginning. The primary advantage of Composition API is that it enables clean, efficient logic reuse in the form ofComposable functions. It solvesall the drawbacks of mixins, the primary logic reuse mechanism for Options API. Composition API's logic reuse capability has given rise to impressive community projects such asVueUse, an ever-growing collection of composable utilities. It also serves as a clean mechanism for easily integrating stateful third-party services or libraries into Vue's reactivity system, for exampleimmutable data,state machines, andRxJS. Many users love that we write organized code by default with Options API: everything has its place based on the option it falls under. However, Options API poses serious limitations when a single component's logic grows beyond a certain complexity threshold. This limitation is particularly prominent in components that need to deal with multiplelogical concerns, which we have witnessed first hand in many production Vue 2 apps. Take the folder explorer component from Vue CLI's GUI as an example: this component is responsible for the following logical concerns:"

                    "type": "p",
                    "text": "Theoriginal versionof the component was written in Options API. If we give each line of code a color based on the logical concern it is dealing with, this is how it looks: Notice how code dealing with the same logical concern is forced to be split under different options, located in different parts of the file. In a component that is several hundred lines long, understanding and navigating a single logical concern requires constantly scrolling up and down the file, making it much more difficult than it should be. In addition, if we ever intend to extract a logical concern into a reusable utility, it takes quite a bit of work to find and extract the right pieces of code from different parts of the file. Here's the same component, before and after therefactor into Composition API:  Notice how the code related to the same logical concern can now be grouped together: we no longer need to jump between different options blocks while working on a specific logical concern. Moreover, we can now move a group of code into an external file with minimal effort, since we no longer need to shuffle the code around in order to extract them. This reduced friction for refactoring is key to the long-term maintainability in large codebases. In recent years, more and more frontend developers are adoptingTypeScriptas it helps us write more robust code, make changes with more confidence, and provides a great development experience with IDE support. However, the Options API, originally conceived in 2013, was designed without type inference in mind. We had to implement someabsurdly complex type gymnasticsto make type inference work with the Options API. Even with all this effort, type inference for Options API can still break down for mixins and dependency injection. This had led many developers who wanted to use Vue with TS to lean towards Class API powered byvue-class-component. However, a class-based API heavily relies on ES decorators, a language feature that was only a stage 2 proposal when Vue 3 was being developed in 2019. We felt it was too risky to base an official API on an unstable proposal. Since then, the decorators proposal has gone through yet another complete overhaul, and finally reached stage 3 in 2022. In addition, class-based API suffers from logic reuse and organization limitations similar to Options API. In comparison, Composition API utilizes mostly plain variables and functions, which are naturally type friendly. Code written in Composition API can enjoy full type inference with little need for manual type hints. Most of the time, Composition API code will look largely identical in TypeScript and plain JavaScript. This also makes it possible for plain JavaScript users to benefit from partial type inference. Code written in Composition API and<script setup>is also more efficient and minification-friendly than Options API equivalent. This is because the template in a<script setup>component is compiled as a function inlined in the same scope of the<script setup>code. Unlike property access fromthis, the compiled template code can directly access variables declared inside<script setup>, without an instance proxy in between. This also leads to better minification because all the variable names can be safely shortened. Some users moving from Options API found their Composition API code less organized, and concluded that Composition API is \"worse\" in terms of code organization. We recommend users with such opinions to look at that problem from a different perspective. It is true that Composition API no longer provides the \"guard rails\" that guide you to put your code into respective buckets. In return, you get to author component code like how you would write normal JavaScript. This meansyou can and should apply any code organization best practices to your Composition API code as you would when writing normal JavaScript. If you can write well-organized JavaScript, you should also be able to write well-organized Composition API code. Options API does allow you to \"think less\" when writing component code, which is why many users love it. However, in reducing the mental overhead, it also locks you into the prescribed code organization pattern with no escape hatch, which can make it difficult to refactor or improve code quality in larger scale projects. In this regard, Composition API provides better long term scalability. Yes in terms of stateful logic. When using Composition API, there are only a few options that may still be needed:props,emits,name, andinheritAttrs. TIP Since 3.3 you can directly usedefineOptionsin<script setup>to set the component name orinheritAttrsproperty If you intend to exclusively use Composition API (along with the options listed above), you can shave a few kbs off your production bundle via acompile-time flagthat drops Options API related code from Vue. Note this also affects Vue components in your dependencies. Yes. You can use Composition API via thesetup()option in an Options API component. However, we only recommend doing so if you have an existing Options API codebase that needs to integrate with new features / external libraries written with Composition API. No, we do not have any plan to do so. Options API is an integral part of Vue and the reason many developers love it. We also realize that many of the benefits of Composition API only manifest in larger-scale projects, and Options API remains a solid choice for many low-to-medium-complexity scenarios. We no longer recommend using Class API with Vue 3, given that Composition API provides great TypeScript integration with additional logic reuse and code organization benefits. Composition API provides the same level of logic composition capabilities as React Hooks, but with some important differences. React Hooks are invoked repeatedly every time a component updates. This creates a number of caveats that can confuse even seasoned React developers. It also leads to performance optimization issues that can severely affect development experience.

This term comes up in programming quite a bit these days, but what do people mean when they say it? Reactivity is a programming paradigm that allows us to adjust to changes in a declarative manner. The canonical example that people usually show, because it’s a great one, is an Excel spreadsheet: Here cell A2 is defined via a formula of= A0 + A1(you can click on A2 to view or edit the formula), so the spreadsheet gives us 3. No surprises there. But if you update A0 or A1, you'll notice that A2 automagically updates too. JavaScript doesn’t usually work like this. If we were to write something comparable in JavaScript:"

Of course, Vue components use much more efficient ways to update the DOM thaninnerHTML. This is discussed inRendering Mechanism. Theref(),computed()andwatchEffect()APIs are all part of the Composition API. If you have only been using Options API with Vue so far, you'll notice that Composition API is closer to how Vue's reactivity system works under the hood. In fact, in Vue 3 the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API. All property access on the component instance (this) triggers getter / setters for reactivity tracking, and options likewatchandcomputedinvoke their Composition API equivalents internally. Vue's reactivity system is primarily runtime-based: the tracking and triggering are all performed while the code is running directly in the browser. The pros of runtime reactivity are that it can work without a build step, and there are fewer edge cases. On the other hand, this makes it constrained by the syntax limitations of JavaScript, leading to the need of value containers like Vue refs. Some frameworks, such asSvelte, choose to overcome such limitations by implementing reactivity during compilation. It analyzes and transforms the code in order to simulate reactivity. The compilation step allows the framework to alter the semantics of JavaScript itself - for example, implicitly injecting code that performs dependency analysis and effect triggering around access to locally defined variables. The downside is that such transforms require a build step, and altering JavaScript semantics is essentially creating a language that looks like JavaScript but compiles into something else. The Vue team did explore this direction via an experimental feature calledReactivity Transform, but in the end we have decided that it would not be a good fit for the project due tothe reasoning here. It's great that Vue's reactivity system automatically tracks dependencies, but in some cases we may want to figure out exactly what is being tracked, or what is causing a component to re-render. We can debug what dependencies are used during a component's render and which dependency is triggering an update using therenderTrackedonRenderTrackedandrenderTriggeredonRenderTriggeredlifecycle hooks. Both hooks will receive a debugger event which contains information on the dependency in question.

The deep conversion can be unnecessary or sometimes unwanted when integrating with external state management systems (e.g. if an external solution also uses Proxies). The general idea of integrating Vue's reactivity system with an external state management solution is to hold the external state in ashallowRef. A shallow ref is only reactive when its.valueproperty is accessed - the inner value is left intact. When the external state changes, replace the ref value to trigger updates. If you are implementing an undo / redo feature, you likely want to take a snapshot of the application's state on every user edit. However, Vue's mutable reactivity system isn't best suited for this if the state tree is large, because serializing the entire state object on every update can be expensive in terms of both CPU and memory costs. Immutable data structuressolve this by never mutating the state objects - instead, it creates new objects that share the same, unchanged parts with old ones.

It's a value container that provides dependency tracking on access, and side-effect triggering on mutation. This reactivity-primitive-based paradigm isn't a particularly new concept in the frontend world: it dates back to implementations likeKnockout observablesandMeteor Trackerfrom more than a decade ago. Vue Options API and the React state management libraryMobXare also based on the same principles, but hide the primitives behind object properties. Although not a necessary trait for something to qualify as signals, today the concept is often discussed alongside the rendering model where updates are performed through fine-grained subscriptions. Due to the use of Virtual DOM, Vue currentlyrelies on compilers to achieve similar optimizations. However, we are also exploring a new Solid-inspired compilation strategy, calledVapor Mode, that does not rely on Virtual DOM and takes more advantage of Vue's built-in reactivity system. The design of Preact and Qwik's signals are very similar to Vue'sshallowRef: all three provide a mutable interface via the.valueproperty. We will focus the discussion on Solid and Angular signals. Solid'screateSignal()API design emphasizes read / write segregation. Signals are exposed as a read-only getter and a separate setter:"

We will attempt to shed some light on these questions here by diving into Vue's internal rendering mechanism. You have probably heard about the term \"virtual DOM\", which Vue's rendering system is based upon. The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM. The concept was pioneered byReact, and has been adopted in many other frameworks with different implementations, including Vue. Virtual DOM is more of a pattern than a specific technology, so there is no one canonical implementation. We can illustrate the idea using a simple example:"

It also contains more children vnodes, which makes it the root of a virtual DOM tree. A runtime renderer can walk a virtual DOM tree and construct a real DOM tree from it. This process is calledmount. If we have two copies of virtual DOM trees, the renderer can also walk and compare the two trees, figuring out the differences, and apply those changes to the actual DOM. This process is calledpatch, also known as \"diffing\" or \"reconciliation\". The main benefit of virtual DOM is that it gives the developer the ability to programmatically create, inspect and compose desired UI structures in a declarative way, while leaving the direct DOM manipulation to the renderer. At the high level, this is what happens when a Vue component is mounted:"

Render functions are typically only used in reusable components that need to deal with highly dynamic rendering logic. Render function usage is discussed in more detail inRender Functions & JSX. The virtual DOM implementation in React and most other virtual-DOM implementations are purely runtime: the reconciliation algorithm cannot make any assumptions about the incoming virtual DOM tree, so it has to fully traverse the tree and diff the props of every vnode in order to ensure correctness. In addition, even if a part of the tree never changes, new vnodes are always created for them on each re-render, resulting in unnecessary memory pressure. This is one of the most criticized aspect of virtual DOM: the somewhat brute-force reconciliation process sacrifices efficiency in return for declarativeness and correctness. But it doesn't have to be that way. In Vue, the framework controls both the compiler and the runtime. This allows us to implement many compile-time optimizations that only a tightly-coupled renderer can take advantage of. The compiler can statically analyze the template and leave hints in the generated code so that the runtime can take shortcuts whenever possible. At the same time, we still preserve the capability for the user to drop down to the render function layer for more direct control in edge cases. We call this hybrid approachCompiler-Informed Virtual DOM. Below, we will discuss a few major optimizations done by the Vue template compiler to improve the virtual DOM's runtime performance.

The renderer is also able to completely skip diffing them when it notices the old vnode and the new vnode are the same one. In addition, when there are enough consecutive static elements, they will be condensed into a single \"static vnode\" that contains the plain HTML string for all these nodes (Example). These static vnodes are mounted by directly settinginnerHTML. They also cache their corresponding DOM nodes on initial mount - if the same piece of content is reused elsewhere in the app, new DOM nodes are created using nativecloneNode(), which is extremely efficient.

Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways to strike the optimal balance between stack complexity, developer experience and end performance. Vue can be used as a standalone script file - no build step required! If you have a backend framework already rendering most of the HTML, or your frontend logic isn't complex enough to justify a build step, this is the easiest way to integrate Vue into your stack. You can think of Vue as a more declarative replacement of jQuery in such cases. Vue also provides an alternative distribution calledpetite-vuethat is specifically optimized for progressively enhancing existing HTML. It has a smaller feature set, but is extremely lightweight and uses an implementation that is more efficient in no-build-step scenarios. You can use Vue tobuild standard Web Componentsthat can be embedded in any HTML page, regardless of how they are rendered. This option allows you to leverage Vue in a completely consumer-agnostic fashion: the resulting web components can be embedded in legacy applications, static HTML, or even applications built with other frameworks. Some applications require rich interactivity, deep session depth, and non-trivial stateful logic on the frontend. The best way to build such applications is to use an architecture where Vue not only controls the entire page, but also handles data updates and navigation without having to reload the page. This type of application is typically referred to as a Single-Page Application (SPA). Vue provides core libraries andcomprehensive tooling supportwith amazing developer experience for building modern SPAs, including:"

Pure client-side SPAs are problematic when the app is sensitive to SEO and time-to-content. This is because the browser will receive a largely empty HTML page, and has to wait until the JavaScript is loaded before rendering anything. Vue provides first-class APIs to \"render\" a Vue app into HTML strings on the server. This allows the server to send back already-rendered HTML, allowing end users to see the content immediately while the JavaScript is being downloaded. Vue will then \"hydrate\" the application on the client side to make it interactive. This is calledServer-Side Rendering (SSR)and it greatly improves Core Web Vital metrics such asLargest Contentful Paint (LCP). There are higher-level Vue-based frameworks built on top of this paradigm, such asNuxt, which allow you to develop a fullstack application using Vue and JavaScript. Server-side rendering can be done ahead of time if the required data is static. This means we can pre-render an entire application into HTML and serve them as static files. This improves site performance and makes deployment a lot simpler since we no longer need to dynamically render pages on each request. Vue can still hydrate such applications to provide rich interactivity on the client. This technique is commonly referred to as Static-Site Generation (SSG), also known asJAMStack. There are two flavors of SSG: single-page and multi-page. Both flavors pre-render the site into static HTML, the difference is that:"

Vuescores a perfect 100% in the Custom Elements Everywhere tests. Consuming custom elements inside a Vue application largely works the same as using native HTML elements, with a few things to keep in mind: By default, Vue will attempt to resolve a non-native HTML tag as a registered Vue component before falling back to rendering it as a custom element. This will cause Vue to emit a \"failed to resolve component\" warning during development. To let Vue know that certain elements should be treated as custom elements and skip component resolution, we can specify thecompilerOptions.isCustomElementoption. If you are using Vue with a build setup, the option should be passed via build configs since it is a compile-time option."

This means it is not ideal to use Vue if you are shipping a single custom element - you may want to use vanilla JavaScript,petite-vue, or frameworks that specialize in small runtime size. However, the base size is more than justifiable if you are shipping a collection of custom elements with complex logic, as Vue will allow each component to be authored with much less code. The more elements you are shipping together, the better the trade-off. If the custom elements will be used in an application that is also using Vue, you can choose to externalize Vue from the built bundle so that the elements will be using the same copy of Vue from the host application. It is recommended to export the individual element constructors to give your users the flexibility to import them on-demand and register them with desired tag names. You can also export a convenience function to automatically register all elements. Here's an example entry point of a Vue custom element library:"

It is also more beginner-friendly by abstracting away the reactivity details and enforcing code organization via option groups. The Composition API is centered around declaring reactive state variables directly in a function scope and composing state from multiple functions together to handle complexity. It is more free-form and requires an understanding of how reactivity works in Vue to be used effectively. In return, its flexibility enables more powerful patterns for organizing and reusing logic.

If you have been learning Vue with Options API only, you can set the API Preference to Composition API (using the toggle at the top of the left sidebar) and re-read theReactivity FundamentalsandLifecycle Hookschapters. In the context of Vue applications, a \"composable\" is a function that leverages Vue's Composition API to encapsulate and reusestateful logic. When building frontend applications, we often need to reuse logic for common tasks. For example, we may need to format dates in many places, so we extract a reusable function for that. This formatter function encapsulatesstateless logic: it takes some input and immediately returns expected output. There are many libraries out there for reusing stateless logic - for examplelodashanddate-fns, which you may have heard of. By contrast, stateful logic involves managing state that changes over time. A simple example would be tracking the current position of the mouse on a page. In real-world scenarios, it could also be more complex logic such as touch gestures or connection status to a database. If we were to implement the mouse tracking functionality using the Composition API directly inside a component, it would look like this:"

The cooler part about composables though, is that you can also nest them: one composable function can call one or more other composable functions. This enables us to compose complex logic using small, isolated units, similar to how we compose an entire application using components.

If the argument is a ref, it returns the ref's value; if the argument is a function, it will call the function and return its return value. Otherwise, it returns the argument as-is. It works similarly tounref(), but with special treatment for functions. Notice thattoValue(url)is calledinsidethewatchEffectcallback. This ensures that any reactive dependencies accessed during thetoValue()normalization are tracked by the watcher. This version ofuseFetch()now accepts static URL strings, refs, and getters, making it much more flexible. The watch effect will run immediately, and will track any dependencies accessed duringtoValue(url). If no dependencies are tracked (e.g. url is already a string), the effect runs only once; otherwise, it will re-run whenever a tracked dependency changes. Here'sthe updated version ofuseFetch(), with an artificial delay and randomized error for demo purposes. It is a convention to name composable functions with camelCase names that start with \"use\". A composable can accept ref or getter arguments even if it doesn't rely on them for reactivity. If you are writing a composable that may be used by other developers, it's a good idea to handle the case of input arguments being refs or getters instead of raw values. ThetoValue()utility function will come in handy for this purpose:"

The main advantage of composables over renderless components is that composables do not incur the extra component instance overhead. When used across an entire application, the amount of extra component instances created by the renderless component pattern can become a noticeable performance overhead. The recommendation is to use composables when reusing pure logic, and use components when reusing both logic and visual layout. If you have experience with React, you may notice that this looks very similar to custom React hooks. Composition API was in part inspired by React hooks, and Vue composables are indeed similar to React hooks in terms of logic composition capabilities. However, Vue composables are based on Vue's fine-grained reactivity system, which is fundamentally different from React hooks' execution model.

When we click on a link in a traditional server-rendered web app, the browser receives an HTML response from the server and reloads the entire page with the new HTML. In aSingle-Page Application(SPA), however, the client-side JavaScript can intercept the navigation, dynamically fetch new data, and update the current page without full page reloads. This typically results in a more snappy user experience, especially for use cases that are more like actual \"applications\", where the user is expected to perform many interactions over a long period of time. In such SPAs, the \"routing\" is done on the client side, in the browser. A client-side router is responsible for managing the application's rendered view using browser APIs such asHistory APIor thehashchangeevent. Vue is well-suited for building SPAs. For most SPAs, it's recommended to use the officially-supportedVue Router library. For more details, see Vue Router'sdocumentation. If you only need very simple routing and do not wish to involve a full-featured router library, you can do so withDynamic Componentsand update the current component state by listening to browserhashchangeeventsor using theHistory API.

Check out more details in theSFC Toolingsection. Some users coming from a traditional web development background may have the concern that SFCs are mixing different concerns in the same place - which HTML/CSS/JS were supposed to separate! To answer this question, it is important for us to agree thatseparation of concerns is not equal to the separation of file types. The ultimate goal of engineering principles is to improve the maintainability of codebases. Separation of concerns, when applied dogmatically as separation of file types, does not help us reach that goal in the context of increasingly complex frontend applications. In modern UI development, we have found that instead of dividing the codebase into three huge layers that interweave with one another, it makes much more sense to divide them into loosely-coupled components and compose them. Inside a component, its template, logic, and styles are inherently coupled, and colocating them actually makes the component more cohesive and maintainable. Note even if you don't like the idea of Single-File Components, you can still leverage its hot-reloading and pre-compilation features by separating your JavaScript and CSS into separate files usingSrc Imports.

Check out more details in theSFC Toolingsection. Some users coming from a traditional web development background may have the concern that SFCs are mixing different concerns in the same place - which HTML/CSS/JS were supposed to separate! To answer this question, it is important for us to agree thatseparation of concerns is not equal to the separation of file types. The ultimate goal of engineering principles is to improve the maintainability of codebases. Separation of concerns, when applied dogmatically as separation of file types, does not help us reach that goal in the context of increasingly complex frontend applications. In modern UI development, we have found that instead of dividing the codebase into three huge layers that interweave with one another, it makes much more sense to divide them into loosely-coupled components and compose them. Inside a component, its template, logic, and styles are inherently coupled, and colocating them actually makes the component more cohesive and maintainable. Note even if you don't like the idea of Single-File Components, you can still leverage its hot-reloading and pre-compilation features by separating your JavaScript and CSS into separate files usingSrc Imports.

It mostly depends on how important time-to-content is for your app. For example, if you are building an internal dashboard where an extra few hundred milliseconds on initial load doesn't matter that much, SSR would be an overkill. However, in cases where time-to-content is absolutely critical, SSR can help you achieve the best possible initial load performance. Static Site Generation (SSG), also referred to as pre-rendering, is another popular technique for building fast websites. If the data needed to server-render a page is the same for every user, then instead of rendering the page every time a request comes in, we can render it only once, ahead of time, during the build process. Pre-rendered pages are generated and served as static HTML files. SSG retains the same performance characteristics of SSR apps: it provides great time-to-content performance. At the same time, it is cheaper and easier to deploy than SSR apps because the output is static HTML and assets. The keyword here isstatic: SSG can only be applied to pages providing static data, i.e. data that is known at build time and can not change between requests. Every time the data changes, a new deployment is needed. If you're only investigating SSR to improve the SEO of a handful of marketing pages (e.g./,/about,/contact, etc.), then you probably want SSG instead of SSR. SSG is also great for content-based websites such as documentation sites or blogs. In fact, this website you are reading right now is statically generated usingVitePress, a Vue-powered static site generator. Let's take a look at the most bare-bones example of Vue SSR in action."

Below we will introduce a few recommended SSR solutions in the Vue ecosystem. Nuxtis a higher-level framework built on top of the Vue ecosystem which provides a streamlined development experience for writing universal Vue applications. Better yet, you can also use it as a static site generator! We highly recommend giving it a try. Quasaris a complete Vue-based solution that allows you to target SPA, SSR, PWA, mobile app, desktop app, and browser extension all using one codebase. It not only handles the build setup, but also provides a full collection of Material Design compliant UI components. Vite provides built-insupport for Vue server-side rendering, but it is intentionally low-level. If you wish to go directly with Vite, check outvite-plugin-ssr, a community plugin that abstracts away many challenging details for you. You can also find an example Vue + Vite SSR project using manual setuphere, which can serve as a base to build upon. Note this is only recommended if you are experienced with SSR / build tools and really want to have complete control over the higher-level architecture. Regardless of your build setup or higher-level framework choice, there are some principles that apply in all Vue SSR applications. During SSR, each request URL maps to a desired state of our application. There is no user interaction and no DOM updates, so reactivity is unnecessary on the server. By default, reactivity is disabled during SSR for better performance. Since there are no dynamic updates, lifecycle hooks such asmountedonMountedorupdatedonUpdatedwillNOTbe called during SSR and will only be executed on the client.The only hooks that are called during SSR arebeforeCreateandcreated You should avoid code that produces side effects that need cleanup inbeforeCreateandcreatedsetup()or the root scope of<script setup>. An example of such side effects is setting up timers withsetInterval. In client-side only code we may setup a timer and then tear it down inbeforeUnmountonBeforeUnmountorunmountedonUnmounted. However, because the unmount hooks will never be called during SSR, the timers will stay around forever. To avoid this, move your side-effect code intomountedonMountedinstead. Universal code cannot assume access to platform-specific APIs, so if your code directly uses browser-only globals likewindowordocument, they will throw errors when executed in Node.js, and vice-versa. For tasks that are shared between server and client but with different platform APIs, it's recommended to wrap the platform-specific implementations inside a universal API, or use libraries that do this for you. For example, you can usenode-fetchto use the same fetch API on both server and client. For browser-only APIs, the common approach is to lazily access them inside client-only lifecycle hooks such asmountedonMounted. Note that if a third-party library is not written with universal usage in mind, it could be tricky to integrate it into a server-rendered app. Youmightbe able to get it working by mocking some of the globals, but it would be hacky and may interfere with the environment detection code of other libraries. In the State Management chapter, we introduced asimple state management pattern using Reactivity APIs. In an SSR context, this pattern requires some additional adjustments. The pattern declares shared state in a JavaScript module's root scope. This makes themsingletons- i.e. there is only one instance of the reactive object throughout the entire lifecycle of our application. This works as expected in a pure client-side Vue application, since the modules in our application are initialized fresh for each browser page visit. However, in an SSR context, the application modules are typically initialized only once on the server, when the server boots up. The same module instances will be reused across multiple server requests, and so will our singleton state objects. If we mutate the shared singleton state with data specific to one user, it can be accidentally leaked to a request from another user. We call thiscross-request state pollution. We can technically re-initialize all the JavaScript modules on each request, just like we do in browsers. However, initializing JavaScript modules can be costly, so this would significantly affect server performance. The recommended solution is to create a new instance of the entire application - including the router and global stores - on each request. Then, instead of directly importing it in our components, we provide the shared state usingapp-level provideand inject it in components that need it:"

Your framework may also have built-in features to make this easier, for example the<ClientOnly>component in VitePress.Use a random number generator library that supports generating with seeds, and guarantee the server run and the client run are using the same seed (e.g. by including the seed in serialized state and retrieving it on the client).",

As a result, end-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications. End-to-end tests focus on multi-page application behavior that makes network requests against your production-built Vue application. They often involve standing up a database or other backend and may even be run against a live staging environment. End-to-end tests will often catch issues with your router, state management library, top-level components (e.g. an App or Layout), public assets, or any request handling. As stated above, they catch critical issues that may be impossible to catch with unit tests or component tests. End-to-end tests do not import any of your Vue application's code but instead rely completely on testing your application by navigating through entire pages in a real browser. End-to-end tests validate many of the layers in your application. They can either target your locally built application or even a live Staging environment. Testing against your Staging environment not only includes your frontend code and static server but all associated backend services and infrastructure. The more your tests resemble how your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. -Kent C. Dodds- Author of the Testing Library By testing how user actions impact your application, E2E tests are often the key to higher confidence in whether an application is functioning properly or not. While end-to-end (E2E) testing on the web has gained a negative reputation for unreliable (flaky) tests and slowing down development processes, modern E2E tools have made strides forward to create more reliable, interactive, and useful tests. When choosing an E2E testing framework, the following sections provide some guidance on things to keep in mind when choosing a testing framework for your application. One of the primary benefits that end-to-end (E2E) testing is known for is its ability to test your application across multiple browsers. While it may seem desirable to have 100% cross-browser coverage, it is important to note that cross browser testing has diminishing returns on a team's resources due to the additional time and machine power required to run them consistently. As a result, it is important to be mindful of this trade-off when choosing the amount of cross-browser testing your application needs. One of the primary problems with end-to-end (E2E) tests and development is that running the entire suite takes a long time. Typically, this is only done in continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Modern E2E testing frameworks have helped to solve this by adding features like parallelization, which allows for CI/CD pipelines to often run magnitudes faster than before. In addition, when developing locally, the ability to selectively run a single test for the page you are working on while also providing hot reloading of tests can help boost a developer's workflow and productivity. While developers have traditionally relied on scanning logs in a terminal window to help determine what went wrong in a test, modern end-to-end (E2E) test frameworks allow developers to leverage tools they are already familiar with, e.g. browser developer tools. When end-to-end (E2E) tests are run in continuous integration/deployment pipelines, they are often run in headless browsers (i.e., no visible browser is opened for the user to watch). A critical feature of modern E2E testing frameworks is the ability to see snapshots and/or videos of the application during testing, providing some insight into why errors are happening. Historically, it was tedious to maintain these integrations."
