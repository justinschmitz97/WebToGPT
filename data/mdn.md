## HTML attribute: accept - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept)

The **`accept`** attribute takes as its value a comma\-separated list of one or more file types, or [unique file type specifiers](#unique_file_type_specifiers), describing which file types to allow.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Overview](#overview)

The accept property is an attribute of the [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) type. It was supported on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element, but was removed in favor of [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file).

Because a given file type may be identified in more than one manner, it's useful to provide a thorough set of type specifiers when you need files of specific type, or use the wild card to denote a type of any format is acceptable.

For instance, there are a number of ways Microsoft Word files can be identified, so a site that accepts Word files might use an `` like this:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
Whereas if you're accepting a media file, you may want to be include any format of that media type:

html\`\`\`
\
\
\

\`\`\`
The `accept` attribute doesn't validate the types of the selected files; it provides hints for browsers to guide users towards selecting the correct file types. It is still possible (in most cases) for users to toggle an option in the file chooser that makes it possible to override this and select any file they wish, and then choose incorrect file types.

Because of this, you should make sure that expected requirement is validated server\-side.

## [Examples](#examples)

When set on a file input type, the native file picker that opens up should only enable selecting files of the correct file type. Most operating systems lighten the files that don't match the criteria and aren't selectable.

html\`\`\`
\
 \Select an audio file:\
 \
\
\
 \Select a video file:\
 \
\
\
 \Select some images:\
 \
\

\`\`\`

Note the last example allows you to select multiple images. See the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#multiple) attribute for more information.

## [Unique file type specifiers](#unique_file_type_specifiers)

A **unique file type specifier** is a string that describes a type of file that may be selected by the user in an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element of type `file`. Each unique file type specifier may take one of the following forms:

* A valid case\-insensitive filename extension, starting with a period (".") character. For example: `.jpg`, `.pdf`, or `.doc`.
* A valid MIME type string, with no extensions.
* The string `audio/*` meaning "any audio file".
* The string `video/*` meaning "any video file".
* The string `image/*` meaning "any image file".

The `accept` attribute takes as its value a string containing one or more of these unique file type specifiers, separated by commas. For example, a file picker that needs content that can be presented as an image, including both standard image formats and PDF files, might look like this:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`## [Using file inputs](#using_file_inputs)

### [A basic example](#a_basic_example)

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \Choose file to upload\
 \
 \
 \
 \Submit\
 \
\

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
div {
 margin\-bottom: 10px;
}

\`\`\`
This produces the following output:

**Note:**
You can find this example on GitHub too — see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/forms/file-examples/simple-file.html), and also [see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/file-examples/simple-file.html).

Regardless of the user's device or operating system, the file input provides a button that opens up a file picker dialog that allows the user to choose a file.

Including the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#multiple) attribute, as shown above, specifies that multiple files can be chosen at once. The user can choose multiple files from the file picker in any way that their chosen platform allows (e.g. by holding down `Shift` or `Control`, and then clicking). If you only want the user to choose a single file per ``, omit the `multiple` attribute.

### [Limiting accepted file types](#limiting_accepted_file_types)

Often you won't want the user to be able to pick any arbitrary type of file; instead, you often want them to select files of a specific type or types. For example, if your file input lets users upload a profile picture, you probably want them to select web\-compatible image formats, such as [JPEG](/en-US/docs/Glossary/JPEG) or [PNG](/en-US/docs/Glossary/PNG).

Acceptable file types can be specified with the [`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#accept) attribute, which takes a comma\-separated list of allowed file extensions or MIME types. Some examples:

* `accept="image/png"` or `accept=".png"` — Accepts PNG files.
* `accept="image/png, image/jpeg"` or `accept=".png, .jpg, .jpeg"` — Accept PNG or JPEG files.
* `accept="image/*"` — Accept any file with an `image/*` MIME type. (Many mobile devices also let the user take a picture with the camera when this is used.)
* `accept=".doc,.docx,.xml,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"` — accept anything that smells like an MS Word document.

Let's look at a more complete example:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \Choose file to upload\
 \
 \
 \
 \Submit\
 \
\

\`\`\`

## HTML attribute: autocomplete - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)

The HTML `autocomplete` attribute lets web developers specify what if any permission the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) has to provide automated assistance in filling out form field values, as well as guidance to the browser as to the type of information expected in the field.

It is available on [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements that take a text or numeric value as input, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) elements, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) elements, and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) elements.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Description](#description)

The `autocomplete` attribute provides a hint to the user agent specifying how to, or indeed whether to, prefill a form control. The attribute value is either the keyword `off` or `on`, or an ordered list of space\-separated tokens.

html\`\`\`
\
\
\
\

\`\`\`
If an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) element has no `autocomplete` attribute, the browser will use the [`autocomplete` attribute of the element's **owning form**](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#autocomplete). The owning form is either the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) matching the `id` specified by the [`form`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#form) attribute of the element (if present) or, more commonly, the `` the element is nested in.

**Note:**
In order to provide autocompletion, user\-agents might require ``/``/`` elements to:

1. Have a `name` and/or `id` attribute
2. Be descendants of a `` element
3. Be owned by a form with a [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) button

If the same list of tokens is used in more than one form control, the user\-agent will autocomplete all occurrences of the same `autocomplete` value with the same data value.

Some tokens may be used more than once with potentially different expected values, such as the `zip-code` token in a form that contains both shipping and billing addresses. Including multiple different tokens in a space\-separated list causes the associated form controls to be given unique autocomplete values: in this case, `autocomplete="shipping zip-code"` and `autocomplete="billing zip-code"`.

Some autocomplete values may need to be re\-used multiple times. For example, a form may contain multiple shipping addresses and therefore multiple occurrences of `"shipping zip-code"` while still expecting different values. To make the autocomplete value unique in these cases, the first token in the space\-separated list of tokens can be a `section-*` token, where the token's first eight characters are always the string "section\-", followed by an alphanumeric string. All form fields given the `section-*` token with the same alphanumeric string belong to the same **named group**.

If including the `autocomplete` attribute on [hidden](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden) input elements (``), its value must be an ordered list of space\-separated tokens; the `on` and `off` keywords are not allowed.

The source of the suggested values is generally up to the browser; typically values come from past values entered by the user, but they may also come from pre\-configured values. For instance, a browser might let the user save their name, address, phone number, and email addresses for autocomplete purposes. The browser may also offer the ability to save encrypted credit card information, for autocompletion following an authentication procedure.

**Note:**
The `autocomplete` attribute also controls whether Firefox will — unlike other browsers — [persist the dynamic disabled state and (if applicable) dynamic checkedness](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5985839/bug-with-firefox-disabled-attribute-of-input-not-resetting-when-refreshing) of an `` element, `` element, or entire `` across page loads. The persistence feature is enabled by default. Setting the value of the `autocomplete` attribute to `off` disables this feature. This works even when the `autocomplete` attribute would normally not apply by virtue of its `type`. See [Firefox bug 654072](https://bugzil.la/654072).

## [Values](#values)

The attribute value is either the keyword `off` or `on`, or a space\-separated `` that describes the meaning of the autocompletion value.

[`off`](#off)

The browser is not permitted to automatically enter or select a value for this field. It is possible that the document or application provides its own autocomplete feature, or that security concerns require that the field's value not be automatically entered.

**Note:**
In most modern browsers, setting `autocomplete` to `"off"` will not prevent a password manager from asking the user if they would like to save username and password information, or from automatically filling in those values in a site's login form. See [Managing autofill for login fields](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#managing_autofill_for_login_fields).

[`on`](#on)

The browser is allowed to automatically complete the input. No guidance is provided as to the type of data expected in the field, so the browser may use its own judgement.

[``](#token-list)

An ordered set of [space\-separated tokens](#token_list_tokens) consisting of autofill detail tokens preceded by optional sectioning and either billing or shipping grouping tokens. Phone numbers, email addresses, and messaging protocol tokens are preceded by a token identifying the type of recipient.

See the [WHATWG Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#autofill) for more detailed information.

### [Token list tokens](#token_list_tokens)

The `` options include, in order:

1. [Group naming token](#named_groups)
2. [Grouping identifier](#grouping_identifier)
3. [Detail tokens](#detail_tokens)
4. [Web authorization](#web_authorization_token)

#### Named groups

To create a named group of form fields, the optional `section-*` token can be used. If present, this token must be the first token in the space\-separated list of tokens.

[`section-*`](#section-)

Defines the name for a group of form controls. A token whose first eight characters are the string "section\-", case\-insensitive, followed by additional characters. All form controls that start with the same token belong to the named group.

#### Grouping identifier

An optional `shipping` or `billing` grouping identifier

[`shipping`](#shipping)

The field identified by subsequent tokens is part of the shipping address or contact information

[`billing`](#billing)

The field identified by subsequent tokens is part of the billing address or contact information

#### Detail tokens

Each space\-separated detail token list includes either a recipient type with digital contact information, in that order, or a space\-separated token list of other tokens.

##### Recipient type

The tokens that identify the type of recipient include:

[`home`](#home)

The contact type identified by subsequent tokens is for contacting the recipient at their residence.

[`work`](#work)

The contact type identified by subsequent tokens is for contacting the recipient at their work.

[`mobile`](#mobile)

The contact type identified by subsequent tokens is for contacting the recipient regardless of location.

[`fax`](#fax)

The recipient identified by subsequent tokens is for a fax machine.

[`page`](#page)

The recipient identified by subsequent tokens is for a pager or beeper.

##### Digital contact tokens

The token or group of tokens for telephone numbers or a number's component parts, phone extensions, email addresses, or instant messaging protocols.

[`tel`](#tel)

A full telephone number, including the country code. If you need to break the phone number up into its components, you can use these values for those fields:

[`tel-country-code`](#tel-country-code)

The country code, such as "1" for the United States, Canada, and other areas in North America and parts of the Caribbean.

[`tel-national`](#tel-national)

The entire phone number without the country code component, including a country\-internal prefix. For the phone number "1\-855\-555\-6502", this field's value would be "855\-555\-6502".

[`tel-area-code`](#tel-area-code)

The area code, with any country\-internal prefix applied if appropriate.

[`tel-local`](#tel-local)

The phone number without the country or area code. This can be split further into two parts, for phone numbers which have an exchange number and then a number within the exchange. For the phone number "555\-6502", use `tel-local-prefix` for "555" and `tel-local-suffix` for "6502".

[`tel-extension`](#tel-extension)

A telephone extension code within the phone number, such as a room or suite number in a hotel or an office extension in a company.

[`email`](#email)

An email address.

[`impp`](#impp)

A URL for an instant messaging protocol endpoint, such as `xmpp:username@example.net`.

##### Other tokens

When the form field is not a phone number, email address, or instant messaging protocol, the space\-separated list of tokens is not preceded by a contact type:

[`name`](#name)

The field expects the value to be a person's full name. Using `name` rather than breaking the name down into its components is generally preferred because it avoids dealing with the wide diversity of human names and how they are structured; however, you can use the following `autocomplete` values if you do need to break the name down into its components:

[`honorific-prefix`](#honorific-prefix)

The prefix or title, such as "Mrs.", "Mr.", "Miss", "Ms.", "Dr.", or "Mlle.".

[`given-name`](#given-name)

The given (or "first") name.

[`additional-name`](#additional-name)

The middle name.

[`family-name`](#family-name)

The family (or "last") name.

[`honorific-suffix`](#honorific-suffix)

The suffix, such as "Jr.", "B.Sc.", "PhD.", "MBASW", or "IV".

[`nickname`](#nickname)

A nickname or handle.

[`username`](#username)

A username or account name.

[`new-password`](#new-password)

A new password. When creating a new account or changing passwords, this should be used for an "Enter your new password" or "Confirm new password" field, as opposed to a general "Enter your current password" field that might be present. This may be used by the browser both to avoid accidentally filling in an existing password and to offer assistance in creating a secure password.

[`current-password`](#current-password)

The user's current password.

[`one-time-code`](#one-time-code)

A one\-time password (OTP) for verifying user identity that is used as an additional factor in a sign\-in flow.
Most commonly this is a code received via some out\-of\-channel mechanism, such as SMS, email, or authenticator application.

[`organization-title`](#organization-title)

A job title, or the title a person has within an organization, such as "Senior Technical Writer", "President", or "Assistant Troop Leader".

[`organization`](#organization)

A company or organization name, such as "Acme Widget Company" or "Girl Scouts of America".

[`street-address`](#street-address)

A street address. This can be multiple lines of text, and should fully identify the location of the address within its second administrative level (typically a city or town), but should not include the city name, ZIP or postal code, or country name.

[`address-line1`, `address-line2`, `address-line3`](#address-line1)

Each individual line of the street address. These should only be present if the `street-address` is not present.

[`address-level4`](#address-level4)

The finest\-grained [administrative level](#administrative_levels_in_addresses), in addresses which have four levels.

[`address-level3`](#address-level3)

The third [administrative level](#administrative_levels_in_addresses), in addresses with at least three administrative levels.

[`address-level2`](#address-level2)

The second [administrative level](#administrative_levels_in_addresses), in addresses with at least two of them. In countries with two administrative levels, this would typically be the city, town, village, or other locality in which the address is located.

[`address-level1`](#address-level1)

The first [administrative level](#administrative_levels_in_addresses) in the address. This is typically the province in which the address is located. In the United States, this would be the state. In Switzerland, the canton. In the United Kingdom, the county.

[`country`](#country)

A country or territory code.

[`country-name`](#country-name)

A country or territory name.

[`postal-code`](#postal-code)

A postal code (in the United States, this is the ZIP code).

[`cc-name`](#cc-name)

The full name as printed on or associated with a payment instrument such as a credit card. Using a full name field is preferred, typically, over breaking the name into pieces.

[`cc-given-name`](#cc-given-name)

A given (first) name as given on a payment instrument like a credit card.

[`cc-additional-name`](#cc-additional-name)

A middle name as given on a payment instrument or credit card.

[`cc-family-name`](#cc-family-name)

A family name, as given on a credit card.

[`cc-number`](#cc-number)

A credit card number or other number identifying a payment method, such as an account number.

[`cc-exp`](#cc-exp)

A payment method expiration date, typically in the form "MM/YY" or "MM/YYYY".

[`cc-exp-month`](#cc-exp-month)

The month in which the payment method expires.

[`cc-exp-year`](#cc-exp-year)

The year in which the payment method expires.

[`cc-csc`](#cc-csc)

The security code for the payment instrument; on credit cards, this is the 3\-digit verification number on the back of the card.

[`cc-type`](#cc-type)

The type of payment instrument (such as "Visa" or "Master Card").

[`transaction-currency`](#transaction-currency)

The currency in which the transaction is to take place.

[`transaction-amount`](#transaction-amount)

The amount, given in the currency specified by `transaction-currency`, of the transaction, for a payment form.

[`language`](#language)

A preferred language, given as a valid [BCP 47 language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag).

[`bday`](#bday)

A birth date, as a full date.

[`bday-day`](#bday-day)

The day of the month of a birth date.

[`bday-month`](#bday-month)

The month of the year of a birth date.

[`bday-year`](#bday-year)

The year of a birth date.

[`sex`](#sex)

A gender identity (such as "Female", "Fa'afafine", "Hijra", "Male", "Nonbinary"), as freeform text without newlines.

[`url`](#url)

A URL, such as a home page or company website address as appropriate given the context of the other fields in the form.

[`photo`](#photo)

The URL of an image representing the person, company, or contact information given in the other fields in the form.

#### Web authorization token

With [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea), the `webauthn` token can be included last to indicate the user agent should show public key credentials when the user is interacting with the control.

[`webauthn` 
Experimental](#webauthn)

Passkeys generated by the [Web Authentication API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API), as requested by a conditional [`navigator.credentials.get()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/get "navigator.credentials.get()") call (i.e., one that includes `mediation: 'conditional'`). If included, this is the last token in the space\-separated token list. See [Sign in with a passkey through form autofill](https://web.dev/articles/passkey-form-autofill) for more details.

## [Examples](#examples)

\`\`\`### [Administrative levels in addresses](#administrative_levels_in_addresses)

The four administrative level fields (`address-level1` through `address-level4`) describe the address in terms of increasing levels of precision within the country in which the address is located. Each country has its own system of administrative levels, and may arrange the levels in different orders when addresses are written.

`address-level1` always represents the broadest administrative division; it is the least\-specific portion of the address short of the country name.

### [Form layout flexibility](#form_layout_flexibility)

Given that different countries write their address in different ways, with each field in different places within the address, and even different sets and numbers of fields entirely, it can be helpful if, when possible, your site is able to switch to the layout expected by your users when presenting an address entry form, given the country the address is located within.

### [Variations](#variations)

The way each administrative level is used will vary from country to country. Below are some examples; this is not meant to be an exhaustive list.

#### United States

A typical home address within the United States looks like this:

432 Anywhere St
Exampleville CA 95555

In the United States, the least\-specific portion of the address is the state, in this case "CA" (the official US Postal Service shorthand for "California"). Thus `address-level1` is the state, or "CA" in this case.

The second\-least specific portion of the address is the city or town name, so `address-level2` is "Exampleville" in this example address.

United States addresses do not use levels 3 and up.

#### United Kingdom

Address input forms in the UK should contain one or two address levels and one, two or three address lines, depending on the address. A complete address would look like so:

103 Frogmarch Street
Upper\-Wapping
Winchelsea
Whereshire
TN99 8ZZ

The address levels are:

* `address-level1`: The county — "Whereshire" in this case.
* `address-level2`: The post town — "Winchelsea" in this case.
* `address-line2`: The locality — "Upper\-Wapping" in this case.
* `address-line1`: The house/street particulars — "103 Frogmarch Street".

The postcode is separate. Note that you can actually use just the postcode and `address-line1` to successfully deliver mail in the UK, so they should be the only mandatory items, but usually people tend to provide more details.

#### China

China can use as many as three administrative levels: the province, the city, and the district.

The 6 digit postal code is not always needed but when supplied it is placed separately with a label for clarity. For example:

北京市东城区建国门北大街 8 号华润大厦 17 层 1708 单元
邮编：100005

#### Japan

An address in Japan is typically **written in one line**, in an order from the least\-specific to more\-specific portions (in **reverse order to the United States**). There are two or three administrative levels in an address. Additional line can be used to show building names and room numbers. The postal code is separate. For example:

〒 381\-0000
長野県長野市某町 123

"〒" and following seven digits shows the postal code.

`address-level1` is used for prefectures or the Tokyo Metropolis; "長野県" (Nagano Prefecture) is in this case. `address-level2` is typically used for cities, counties, towns and villages; "長野市" (Nagano City) in this case. "某町 123" is `address-line1` which consists of an area name and a lot number.

## HTML attribute: capture - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture)

The **`capture`** attribute specifies that, optionally, a new file should be captured, and which device should be used to capture that new media of a type defined by the [`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept) attribute.

Values include `user` and `environment`. The capture attribute is supported on the [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) input type.

The `capture` attribute takes as its value a string that specifies which camera to use for capture of image or video data, if the [accept](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept) attribute indicates that the input should be of one of those types.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `user` | The user\-facing camera and/or microphone should be used. |
| `environment` | The outward\-facing camera and/or microphone should be used |

**Note:**
Capture was previously a Boolean attribute which, if present, requested that the device's media capture device(s) such as camera or microphone be used instead of requesting a file input.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Examples](#examples)

When set on a file input type, operating systems with microphones and cameras will display a user interface allowing the selection from an existing file or the creating of a new one.

## HTML attribute: crossorigin - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin)

The **`crossorigin`** attribute, valid on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) elements, provides support for [CORS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), defining how the element handles cross\-origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.

The `crossorigin` content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute.

These attributes are [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated), and have the following possible values:

Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to `'same-origin'`. There is no exchange of **user credentials** via cookies, client\-side TLS certificates or HTTP authentication, unless destination is the same origin.

[`use-credentials`](#use-credentials)

Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to `'include'` and **user credentials** are always included.

[`""`](#sect)

Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like `crossorigin` or `crossorigin=""`, is the same as `anonymous`.

An invalid keyword and an empty string will be handled as the `anonymous` keyword.

By default (that is, when the attribute is not specified), CORS is not used at all. The user agent will not ask for permission for full access to the resource and in the case of a cross\-origin request, certain limitations will be applied based on the type of element concerned:

| Element | Restrictions |
| --- | --- |
| `img`, `audio`, `video` | When resource is placed in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas), element is marked as [*tainted*](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image#security_and_tainted_canvases). |
| `script` | Access to error logging via [`window.onerror`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/error_event "window.onerror") will be limited. |
| `link` | Request with no appropriate `crossorigin` header may be discarded. |

**Note:**
The `crossorigin` attribute is not supported for [`rel="icon"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#icon) in Chromium\-based browsers. See the [open Chromium issue](https://crbug.com/1121645).

### [Example: `crossorigin` with the `` element](#example_crossorigin_with_the_script_element)

You can use the following [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) element to tell a browser to execute the `https://example.com/example-framework.js` script without sending user\-credentials.

html\`\`\`
\\

\`\`\`### [Example: Web manifest with credentials](#example_web_manifest_with_credentials)

The `use-credentials` value must be used when fetching a [manifest](/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) that requires credentials, even if the file is from the same origin.

## HTML attribute: dirname - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/dirname)

The **`dirname`** attribute can be used on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) element and several [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) types and describes the directionality of the element's text content during form submission.
The browser uses this attribute's value to determine whether text the user has entered is left\-to\-right or right\-to\-left oriented.
When used, the element's text directionality value is included in form submission data along with the `dirname` attribute's value as the name of the field.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `dirname` attribute can be used on any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) element, or any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element with [hidden](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden), [text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text), [search](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search), [tel](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel), [url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url), [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password), [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit), [reset](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/reset) or [button](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/button) type.

The format of the submitted data is `{dirname_value}={direction}` where `{dirname_value}` is the value of the `dirname` attribute and `{direction}` is the directionality of the text.
For example, if the user enters "Hello" in an element with the attributes `name="comment"` and `dirname="comment-direction"`, the URL\-encoded form submission data for `GET` requests will be `comment=Hello&comment-direction=ltr`.
The directionality is one of the following:

[`rtl`](#rtl)

The text entered by the user is in a right\-to\-left writing direction.

[`ltr`](#ltr)

The text entered by the user is in a left\-to\-right writing direction.

If no text directionality is specified, the user agent will use the directionality of the parent element containing the form, and if that is not specified, the default directionality of the user agent.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Textarea element directionality](#textarea_element_directionality)

In this example, the `dir="auto"` attribute on the textarea element allows the text directionality to be determined automatically based on the text entered by the user:

html\`\`\`
\
 \سيب\
 \Send my greetings\
\

\`\`\`
When the user submits the form, the user agent includes two fields, one called `comment` with the value "سيب", and one called `comment-direction` with the value "rtl".
The URL\-encoded submission body looks like this:

url\`\`\`
https://www.example.com/submit?comment=%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8\&comment\-direction=rtl

\`\`\`### [Input element directionality](#input_element_directionality)

In this example, the `dir="auto"` attribute on the input element allows the text directionality to be determined automatically based on the text entered by the user:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \Send my greetings\
\

\`\`\`
When the user submits the form, the user agent includes two fields, one called `comment-input` with the value "Hello", and one called `comment-direction` with the value "ltr":

url\`\`\`
https://www.example.com/submit?comment\-input=Hello\&comment\-direction=ltr

\`\`\`### [Inheriting directionality](#inheriting_directionality)

The following `` and `` elements do not have a `dir` attribute, so they inherit the explicit directionality of their parent element, which is `rtl`:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \LTR Comment\
 \Post Comment\
 \
\

\`\`\`
The URL\-encoded submission body looks like this:

url\`\`\`
https://www.example.com/submit?user=LTR\+Username\&user\-direction=rtl\&comment=LTR\+Comment\&comment\-direction=rtl

## HTML attribute: disabled - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)

The Boolean **`disabled`** attribute, when present, makes the element not mutable, focusable, or even submitted with the form. The user can neither edit nor focus on the control, nor its form control descendants.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Overview](#overview)

If the `disabled` attribute is specified on a form control, the element and its form control descendants do not participate in constraint validation. Often browsers grey out such controls and it won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus\-related ones.

The `disabled` attribute is supported by [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input).

This Boolean disabled attribute indicates that the user cannot interact with the control or its descendant controls. If this attribute is not specified, the control inherits its setting from the containing element, for example `fieldset`; if there is no containing element with the `disabled` attribute set, and the control itself does not have the attribute, then the control is enabled. If declared on an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup), the select is still interactive (unless otherwise disabled), but none of the items in the option group are selectable.

**Note:**
If a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset) is disabled, the descendant form controls are all disabled, with the exception of form controls within the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend).

When a supporting element has the `disabled` attribute applied, the [`:disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:disabled) pseudo\-class also applies to it. Conversely, elements that support the `disabled` attribute but don't have the attribute set match the [`:enabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:enabled) pseudo\-class.

This Boolean attribute prevents the user from interacting with the button. If this attribute isn't set, the button can still be disabled from a containing element, for example [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset); if there is no containing element with the `disabled` attribute set, then the button is enabled.

Firefox will, unlike other browsers, persist the dynamic disabled state of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) across page loads. Use the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute to control this feature.

### [Attribute interactions](#attribute_interactions)

The difference between `disabled` and [`readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) is that read\-only controls can still function and are still focusable, whereas disabled controls can not receive focus and are not submitted with the form and generally do not function as controls until they are enabled.

Because a disabled field cannot have its value changed, [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required) does not have any effect on inputs with the `disabled` attribute also specified. Additionally, since the elements become immutable, most other attributes, such as [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern), have no effect, until the control is enabled.

**Note:**
The `required` attribute is not permitted on inputs with the `disabled` attribute specified.

### [Usability](#usability)

Browsers display disabled form controls greyed as disabled form controls are immutable, won't receive focus or any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus\-related ones, and aren't submitted with the form.

If present on a supporting elements, the [`:disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:disabled) pseudo class will match. If the attribute is not included, the [`:enabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:enabled) pseudo class will match. If the element doesn't support the disabled attribute, the attribute will have no effect, including not leading to being matched by the `:disabled` and `:enabled` pseudo classes.

### [Constraint validation](#constraint_validation)

If the element is `disabled`, then the element's value can not receive focus and cannot be updated by the user, and does not participate in constraint validation.

## [Examples](#examples)

When form controls are disabled, many browsers will display them in a lighter, greyed\-out color by default. Here are examples of a disabled checkbox, radio button, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup), as well as some form controls that are disabled via the disabled attribute set on the ancestor `[](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset)` element. The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option)s are disabled, but the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) itself is not. We could have disable the entire [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) by adding the attribute to that element rather than its descendants.

## HTML attribute: elementtiming - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/elementtiming)

The **`elementtiming`** attribute is used to indicate that an element is flagged for tracking by [`PerformanceObserver`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver) objects using the `"element"` type. For more details, see the [`PerformanceElementTiming`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceElementTiming) interface.

This attribute may be applied to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/image) elements inside an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg), poster images of [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) elements, elements which have a [`background-image`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image), and elements containing text nodes, such as a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p).

In the DOM, this attribute is reflected as [`Element.elementTiming`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/elementTiming).

## [Usage](#usage)

The value given for `elementtiming` becomes an identifier for the observed element.

## HTML attribute: max - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max)

The **`max`** attribute defines the maximum value that is acceptable and valid for the input containing the attribute. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value) of the element is greater than this, the element fails [validation](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation). This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min) attribute. If the `max` attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no `max` value is applied. If the `max` attribute is valid and a non\-empty value is greater than the maximum allowed by the `max` attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission.

The max attribute is valid for the numeric input types, including the [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date), [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month), [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week), [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time), [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local), [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) and [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) types, and both the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) elements. It is a number that specifies the most positive value a form control to be considered valid.

If the value exceeds the max value allowed, the [`validityState.rangeOverflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/rangeOverflow) will be true, and the control will be matched by the [`:out-of-range`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:out-of-range) and [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) pseudo\-classes.

## [Syntax](#syntax)

 Syntax for
 `max`
 values by input

| Input type | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) | `yyyy-mm-dd` | `` |
| [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month) | `yyyy-mm` | `` |
| [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week) | `yyyy-W##` | `` |
| [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time) | `HH:mm` | `` |
| [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) | `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm` | `` |
| [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) | [\](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) | `` |
| [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) | [\](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) | `` |

**Note:**
When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the maximum value set, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation and will match the [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) and [`:out-of-range`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:out-of-range) pseudo\-classes.

See [Client\-side validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) and [`rangeOverflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/rangeOverflow "rangeOverflow") for more information.

For the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress) element, the `max` attribute describes how much work the task indicated by the `progress` element requires. If present, must have a value greater than zero and be a valid floating point number. For the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) element, the `max` attribute defines the upper numeric bound of the measured range. This must be greater than the minimum value ([`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min) attribute), if specified. In both cases, if omitted, the value defaults to 1\.

 Syntax for
 `max`
 values for other elements

| Input type | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress) | [\](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) | ` 70%  ` |
| [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) | [\](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) | ` at 40/100` |

## [Accessibility concerns](#accessibility_concerns)

Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the `max` attribute, ensure this maximum requirement is understood by the user. Providing instructions within the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) may be sufficient. If providing instructions outside of labels, which allows more flexible positioning and design, consider using [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby).

## HTML attribute: maxlength - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength)

The **`maxlength`** attribute defines the maximum [string length](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length) that the user can enter into an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea). The attribute must have an integer value of 0 or higher.

The length is measured in UTF\-16 code units, which ([for most scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length#strings_with_length_not_equal_to_the_number_of_characters)) is equivalent to the number of characters. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no maximum length.

Any `maxlength` value must be greater than or equal to the value of [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/minlength), if present and valid. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text value of the field is greater than maxlength UTF\-16 code units long. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user.

### [Constraint validation](#constraint_validation)

While the browser will generally prevent user from entering more text than the maxlength attribute allows, should the length be longer than the maxlength allows, the read\-only [`tooLong`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooLong "tooLong") property of a [`ValidityState`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) object will be true.

## HTML attribute: min - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min)

The **`min`** attribute defines the minimum value that is acceptable and valid for the input containing the attribute. If the [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value) of the element is less than this, the element fails [validation](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation). This value must be less than or equal to the value of the `max` attribute.

Some input types have a default minimum. If the input has no default minimum and a value is specified for `min` that can't be converted to a valid number (or no minimum value is set), the input has no minimum value.

It is valid for the input types including: [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date), [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month), [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week), [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time), [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local), [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) and [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) types, and the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) element.

## [Syntax](#syntax)

 Syntax for
 `min`
 values by input
 `type`

| Input type | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) | `yyyy-mm-dd` | `` |
| [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month) | `yyyy-mm` | `` |
| [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week) | `yyyy-W##` | `` |
| [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time) | `HH:mm` | `` |
| [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) | `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:mm` | `` |
| [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) | [\](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) | `` |
| [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) | [\](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) | `` |

**Note:**
When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the min value set, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation and will match the [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) and [`:out-of-range`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:out-of-range) pseudo\-classes.

See [Client\-side validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) and [`rangeUnderflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/rangeUnderflow "rangeUnderflow") for more information.

For the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) element, the `min` attribute defines the lower numeric bound of the measured range. This must be less than the maximum value ([`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max) attribute), if specified. In both cases, if omitted, the value defaults to 1\.

 Syntax for
 `min`
 values for other elements

| Input type | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) | [\](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) | ` at 40/100` |

### [Impact on step](#impact_on_step)

The value of `min` and `step` define what are valid values, even if the `step` attribute is not included, as `step` defaults to `0`.

We add a big red border around invalid inputs:

css\`\`\`
input:invalid {
 border: solid red 3px;
}

\`\`\`
Then define an input with a minimum value of 7\.2, omitting the step attribute, wherein it defaults to 1\.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
Because `step` defaults to 1, valid values include `7.2`, `8.2`, `9.2`, and so on. The value 8 is not valid. As we included an invalid value, supporting browsers will show the value as invalid.

If not explicitly included, `step` defaults to 1 for `number` and `range`, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types.

## [Accessibility concerns](#accessibility_concerns)

Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the `min` attribute, ensure this minimum requirement is understood by the user. Providing instructions within the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) may be sufficient. If providing instructions outside of labels, which allows more flexible positioning and design, consider using [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby).

## HTML attribute: minlength - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/minlength)

The **`minlength`** attribute defines the minimum [string length](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length) that the user can enter into an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea). The attribute must have an integer value of 0 or higher.

The length is measured in UTF\-16 code units, which ([for most scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length#strings_with_length_not_equal_to_the_number_of_characters)) is equivalent to the number of characters. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. This value must be less than or equal to the value of [maxlength](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength), otherwise the value will never be valid, as it is impossible to meet both criteria.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text value of the field is less than minlength UTF\-16 code units long, with [`validityState.tooShort`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooShort) returning `true`. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user. Once submission fails, some browsers will display an error message indicating the minimum length required and the current length.

`minlength` does not imply [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required); an input only violates a `minlength` constraint if the user has input a value. If an input is not `required`, an empty string can be submitted even if `minlength` is set.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Examples](#examples)

By adding `minlength="5"`, the value must either be empty or five characters or longer to be valid.

html\`\`\`
\Enter a fruit name that is at least 5 letters long\
\

\`\`\`
We can use pseudoclasses to style the element based on whether the value is valid. The value will be valid as long as it is either null (empty) or five or more characters long. *Lime* is invalid, *lemon is valid*.

css\`\`\`
input {
 border: 2px solid currentcolor;
}
input:invalid {
 border: 2px dashed red;
}
input:invalid:focus {

## HTML attribute: multiple - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/multiple)

The Boolean **`multiple`** attribute, if set, means the form control accepts one or more values. The attribute is valid for the [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email) and [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) input types and the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select). The manner by which the user opts for multiple values depends on the form control.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Overview](#overview)

Depending on the type, the form control may have a different appearance if the `multiple` attribute is set. For the file input type, the native messaging the browser provides differs. In Firefox, the file input reads "No files selected" when the attribute is present and "No file selected" when it is not. Most browsers display a scrolling list box for a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) control with the `multiple` attribute set and a single line dropdown when the attribute is omitted. The [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email) input displays the same whether or not the `multiple` attribute is included, but will match the [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) pseudo\-class if more than one comma\-separated email address is included if the attribute is not present.

When `multiple` is set on the [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email) input type, the user can include zero (if not also [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required)), one or more comma\-separated email addresses.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
If and only if the `multiple` attribute is specified, the value can be a list of properly\-formed comma\-separated email addresses. Any trailing and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the list.

When `multiple` is set on the [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) input type, the user can select one or more files. The user can choose multiple files from the file picker in any way that their chosen platform allows (e.g. by holding down `Shift` or `Control`, and then clicking).

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
When the attribute is omitted, the user can only select a single file per ``.

The `multiple` attribute on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element represents a control for selecting zero or more options from the list of options. Otherwise, the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element represents a control for selecting a single [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) from the list of options.

html\`\`\`
\
 \Grumpy\
 \Happy\
 \Sleepy\
 \Bashful\
 \Sneezy\
 \Dopey\
 \Doc\
\

\`\`\`
When `multiple` is specified, most browsers will show a scrolling list box instead of a single line dropdown.

## [Accessibility concerns](#accessibility_concerns)

Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the `multiple` attribute, inform the user that multiple values are allowed and provide directions on how to provide multiple values, such as "separate email addresses with a comma."

Setting `size="1"` on a multiple select can make it appear as a single select in some browsers, but then it doesn't expand on focus, harming usability. Don't do that. If you do change the appearance of a select, and even if you don't, make sure to inform the user that more than one option can be selected by another method.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [email input](#email_input)

html\`\`\`
\Who do you want to email?\
\

\
 \Grumpy\
 \Happy\
 \Sleepy\
 \Bashful\
 \Sneezy\
 \Dopey\
 \Doc\
\

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
input:invalid {
 border: red solid 3px;
}

\`\`\`
If and only if the `multiple` attribute is specified, the value can be a list of properly\-formed comma\-separated email addresses. Any trailing and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the list. If the [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required) attribute is present, at least one email address is required.

Some browsers support the appearance of the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#list) of options from the associated [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) for subsequent email addresses when `multiple` is present. Others do not.

### [file input](#file_input)

When `multiple` is set on the [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) input type, the user can select one or more files:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \ Choose the images you want to upload: \
 \
 \
 \
 \Pick a text file to upload: \
 \
 \
 \
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`

Note the difference in appearance between the example with `multiple` set and the other `file` input without.

When the form is submitted, had we used [`method="get"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) each selected file's name would have been added to URL parameters as `?uploads=img1.jpg&uploads=img2.svg`. However, since we are submitting multipart form data, we must use post. See the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element and [sending form data](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data#the_method_attribute) for more information.

### [select](#select)

The `multiple` attribute on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element represents a control for selecting zero or more options from the list of options. Otherwise, the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element represents a control for selecting a single [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) from the list of options. The control generally has a different appearance based on the presence of the multiple attribute, with most browsers displaying a scrolling list box instead of a single line dropdown when the attribute is present.

html\`\`\`

 \
 \
 \
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`

Note the difference in appearance between the two form controls.

css\`\`\`
/\* uncomment this CSS to make the multiple the same height as the single \*/

/\*

 vertical\-align: top;
}
select\[multiple]:focus,
select\[multiple]:active {
 height: auto;
}
\*/

\`\`\`
There are a few ways to select multiple options in a `` element with a `multiple` attribute. Depending on the operating system, mouse users can hold the `Ctrl`, `Command`, or `Shift` keys and then click multiple options to select/deselect them. Keyboard users can select multiple contiguous items by focusing on the `` element, selecting an item at the top or bottom of the range they want to select using the `Up` and `Down` cursor keys to go up and down the options. The selection of non\-contiguous is not as well\-supported: items should be able to be selected and deselected by pressing `Space`, but support varies between browsers.

## HTML attribute: pattern - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern)

The **`pattern`** attribute specifies a [regular expression](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) the form control's value should match. If a non\-`null` value doesn't conform to the constraints set by the `pattern` value, the [`ValidityState`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) object's read\-only [`patternMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/patternMismatch "patternMismatch") property will be true.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Overview](#overview)

The `pattern` attribute is an attribute of the [text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text), [tel](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel), [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email), [url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password), and [search](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search) input types.

The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression which the input's [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value) must match for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the [`RegExp`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions).

The pattern's regular expression is compiled with the [`'v'` flag](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_class#v-mode_character_class). This makes the regular expression [unicode\-aware](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicode#unicode-aware_mode), and also changes how character classes are interpreted. This allows character class set intersection and subtraction operations, and in addition to `]` and `\`, the following characters must be escaped using a `\` backslash if they represent literal characters: `(`, `)`, `[`, `{`, `}`, `/`, `-`, `|`. Before mid\-2023, the `'u'` flag was specified instead; If you're updating older code, [this document outlines the differences](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-v-flag#how-is-the-v-flag-different-from-the-u-flag).

The pattern's regular expression must match the entire input's `value`, rather than matching a substring \- as if a `^(?:` were implied at the start of the pattern and `)$` at the end.

No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. No regular expression is applied if the attribute value is absent, an empty string, or invalid.

Some of the input types supporting the pattern attribute, notably the [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email) and [url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url) input types, have expected value syntaxes that must be matched. If the pattern attribute isn't present, and the value doesn't match the expected syntax for that value type, the [`ValidityState`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) object's read\-only [`typeMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/typeMismatch "typeMismatch") property will be true.

### [Constraint validation](#constraint_validation)

If the input's value is not the empty string and the value does not match the entire regular expression, there is a constraint violation reported by the [`ValidityState`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState) object's [`patternMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/patternMismatch "patternMismatch") property being `true`.

**Note:**
If the `pattern` attribute is specified with no value, its value is implicitly the empty string. Thus, **any non\-empty** input `value` will result in constraint violation.

### [Usability and accessibility considerations](#usability_and_accessibility_considerations)

When including a `pattern`, provide a description of the pattern in visible text near the control. Additionally, include a [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#title) attribute which gives a description of the pattern. User agents may use the title contents during constraint validation to tell the user that the pattern is not matched. Some browsers show a tooltip with title contents, improving usability for sighted users. Additionally, assistive technology may read the title aloud when the control gains focus, but this should not be relied upon for accessibility.

Only relying on the `title` attribute for the visual display of text content is discouraged, as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner. Although some browsers show a tooltip when an element with a title is hovered, that leaves out keyboard\-only and touch\-only users. This is one of the several reasons you must include information informing users how to fill out the control to match the requirements.

While `title`s are used by some browsers to populate error messaging, because browsers sometimes also show the title as text on hover, it therefore shows in non\-error situations, so be careful not to word titles as if an error has occurred.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Matching a phone number](#matching_a_phone_number)

Given the following:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 Enter your phone number in the format (123\) \- 456 \- 7890 (\) \-
 \
 \-
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
Here we have 3 sections for a north American phone number with an implicit label encompassing all three components of the phone number, expecting 3\-digits, 3\-digits and 4\-digits respectively, as defined by the `pattern` attribute set on each.

If the values are too long or too short, or contain characters that aren't digits, the `patternMismatch` will be true. When `true`, the element matches the [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) CSS pseudo\-classes.

css\`\`\`
input:invalid {
 border: red solid 3px;
}

\`\`\`

If we had used [`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/minlength) and [`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength) attributes instead, we may have seen [`validityState.tooLong`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooLong) or [`validityState.tooShort`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooShort) being true.

### [Specifying a pattern](#specifying_a_pattern)

You can use the [`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#pattern) attribute to specify a regular expression that the inputted value must match in order to be considered valid (see [Validating against a regular expression](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation#validating_against_a_regular_expression) for a crash course on using regular expressions to validate inputs).

The example below restricts the value to 4\-8 characters and requires that it contain only lower\-case letters.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \Choose a username: \
 \
 \\
 \Usernames must be lowercase and 4\-8 characters in length.\
 \
 \
 \Submit\
 \
\

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
div {
 margin\-bottom: 10px;
 position: relative;
}

p {
 font\-size: 80%;
 color: \#999;
}

input \+ span {
 padding\-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid \+ span::after {
 position: absolute;
 content: "✖";
 padding\-left: 5px;
}

input:valid \+ span::after {
 position: absolute;
 content: "✓";
 padding\-left: 5px;
}

\`\`\`
This renders like so:

## HTML attribute: placeholder - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/placeholder)

The **`placeholder`** attribute defines the text displayed in a form control when the control has no value. The placeholder text should provide a brief hint to the user as to the expected type of data that should be entered into the control.

Effective placeholder text includes a word or short phrase that hints at the expected data type, not an explanation or prompt. The placeholder must not be used instead of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label). As the placeholder is not visible if the value of the form control is not null, using `placeholder` instead of a `` for a prompt harms usability and accessibility.

The `placeholder` attribute is supported by the following input types: `[text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text)`, `[search](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search)`, `[url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url)`, `[tel](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel)`, `[email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email)`, and `[password](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password)`. It is also supported by the `[](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea)` element. The [example](#example) below shows the `placeholder` attribute in use to explain the expected format of an input field.

**Note:**
Except in `[](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea)` elements, the `placeholder` attribute can't include any line feeds (LF) or carriage returns (CR). If either is included in the value, the placeholder text will be clipped.

Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the type of data that should be entered into a form; never as a replacement for a `` element; doing so harms accessibility and user experience.

The `` text is visually and programmatically associated with its corresponding form control. Screen readers don't announce placeholder content by default, but they do announce label content; it's the label that informs assistive technology users what data should be entered in the control. Labels also improve user experience for users of pointing devices: When a user clicks, touches, or taps a ``, focus is moved to the label's associated form control.

Placeholders can not be relied upon as a replacement for a label even for those not relying on assistive technology. Placeholder text is displayed at lower color contrast than the default form control text. This is by design, as you don't want users to be confused by what is placeholder text versus what is a filled\-in form field. However, this lack of contrast can cause issues for low\-vision users. Additionally, placeholder text disappears from form fields when users start entering text. If the placeholder text contains instructional information or examples that disappear, it can be confusing to users with cognitive issues and can make the form inaccessible if the placeholder contained the label.

## HTML attribute: readonly - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly)

The Boolean **`readonly`** attribute, when present, makes the element not mutable, meaning the user can not edit the control.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Overview](#overview)

If the `readonly` attribute is specified on an input element, because the user can not edit the input, the element does not participate in constraint validation.

The `readonly` attribute is supported by `[text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text)`, `[search](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search)`, `[url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url)`, `[tel](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel)`, `[email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email)`, `[password](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password)`, `[date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)`, `[month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month)`, `[week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week)`, `[time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time)`, `[datetime-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local)`, and `[number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number)` [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) types and the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) form control elements. If present on any of these input types and elements, the [`:read-only`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:read-only) pseudo class will match. If the attribute is not included, the [`:read-write`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:read-write) pseudo class will match.

The attribute is not supported or relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) or input types that are already not mutable, such as `[checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox)` and `[radio](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio)` or cannot, by definition, start with a value, such as the `[file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file)` input type. `[range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range)` and `[color](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color)`, as both have default values. It is also not supported on `[hidden](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden)` as it can not be expected that a user to fill out a form that is hidden. Nor is it supported on any of the button types, including `image`.

**Note:**
Only text controls can be made read\-only, since for other controls (such as checkboxes and buttons) there is no useful distinction between being read\-only and being disabled, so the `readonly` attribute does not apply.

When an input has the `readonly` attribute, the [`:read-only`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:read-only) pseudo\-class also applies to it. Conversely, inputs that support the `readonly` attribute but don't have the attribute set match the [`:read-write`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:read-write) pseudo\-class.

### [Attribute interactions](#attribute_interactions)

The difference between [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) and `readonly` is that read\-only controls can still function and are still focusable, whereas disabled controls can not receive focus and are not submitted with the form and generally do not function as controls until they are enabled.

Because a read\-only field cannot have its value changed by a user interaction, [`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required) does not have any effect on inputs with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

The only way to modify dynamically the value of the readonly attribute is through a script.

**Note:**
The `required` attribute is not permitted on inputs with the `readonly` attribute specified.

### [Usability](#usability)

Browsers display the `readonly` attribute.

### [Constraint validation](#constraint_validation)

If the element is read\-only, then the element's value can not be updated by the user, and does not participate in constraint validation.

## HTML attribute: rel - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel)

The **`rel`** attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource and the current document. Valid on [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), the supported values depend on the element on which the attribute is found.

The type of relationships is given by the value of the `rel` attribute, which, if present, must have a value that is an unordered set of unique space\-separated keywords. Differently from a `class` name, which does not express semantics, the `rel` attribute must express tokens that are semantically valid for both machines and humans. The current registries for the possible values of the `rel` attribute are the [IANA link relation registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml), the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#linkTypes), and the freely\-editable [existing\-rel\-values page](https://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values) in the microformats wiki, [as suggested](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#other-link-types) by the Living Standard. If a `rel` attribute not present in one of the three sources above is used some HTML validators (such as the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)) will generate a warning.

The following table lists some of the most important existing keywords. Every keyword within a space\-separated value should be unique within that value.

| `rel` value | Description | [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) | [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) | [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) |

The `rel` attribute is relevant to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) elements, but some values only relevant to a subset of those elements. Like all HTML keyword attribute values, these values are case\-insensitive.

The `rel` attribute has no default value. If the attribute is omitted or if none of the values in the attribute are supported, then the document has no particular relationship with the destination resource other than there being a hyperlink between the two. In this case, on [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), if the `rel` attribute is absent, has no keywords, or if not one or more of the space\-separated keywords above, then the element does not create any links. [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) will still created links, but without a defined relationship.

## [Values](#values)

[`alternate`](#alternate)

Indicates an alternate representation of the current document. Valid for [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), the meaning depends on the values of the other attributes.

* With the [`stylesheet`](#stylesheet) keyword on a ``, it creates an [alternate stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets).

html\`\`\`
\
\
\
\

\`\`\`
* With an [`hreflang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#hreflang) attribute that differs from the document language, it indicates a translation.
* With the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#type) attribute value of `"application/rss+xml"` or `"application/atom+xml"`, it creates a hyperlink referencing a syndication feed.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
* Otherwise, it creates a hyperlink referencing an alternate representation of the current document, whose nature is given by the [`hreflang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#hreflang) and [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#type) attributes.

	+ If `hreflang` is given alongside `alternate`, and the value of `hreflang` is different from the current document's language, it indicates that the referenced document is a translation.
	+ If `type` is given alongside `alternate`, it indicates that the referenced document is an alternative format (such as a PDF).
	+ The `hreflang` and `type` attributes may both be given alongside `alternate`.html\`\`\`
\
\

\`\`\`

[`author`](#author)

Indicates the referenced document provides further information about the author of the current document or article. Relevant for [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements.

With [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), it indicates the linked document (or `mailto:`) provides information about the author of the nearest [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) ancestor if there is one, otherwise the entire document.

With [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), it represents the author of the entire document.

**Note:**
For historical reasons, the obsolete attribute value `rev="made"` is treated as `rel="author"`.

[`bookmark`](#bookmark)

Relevant as the `rel` attribute value for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements. Gives a permalink for the nearest ancestor [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) element, if there is one. If there is no ancestor `` element, gives a permalink for the section the linking element is most closely associated with.

[`canonical`](#canonical)

Valid for [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), it defines the preferred URL for the current document, which helps search engines reduce duplicate content.

[`dns-prefetch`](#dns-prefetch)

Relevant for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) element both in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head), it tells the browser to preemptively perform DNS resolution for the target resource's origin. Useful for resources the user will likely need, it helps reduce latency and thereby improves performance when the user does access the resources as the browser preemptively performed DNS resolution for the origin of the specified resource. See [dns\-prefetch](/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/dns-prefetch) described in [resource hints](https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/).

[`external`](#external)

Relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), it indicates the referenced document is not part of the current site. This can be used with attribute selectors to style external links in a way that indicates to the user that they will be leaving the current site.

[`expect` 
Experimental](#expect)

Allows the page to be [render\-blocked](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Render_blocking) until the essential parts of the document are parsed so it will render consistently. Note that render\-blocking occurs only when supplemented with the [`blocking="render"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#blocking) attribute.

**Note:**
See [Stabilizing page state to make cross\-document transitions consistent](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#stabilizing_page_state_to_make_cross-document_transitions_consistent) for more information on its use.

[`help`](#help)

Relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), the `help` keyword indicates that the linked to content provides context\-sensitive help, providing information for the parent of the element defining the hyperlink, and its children. When used within ``, the help is for the whole document. When included with [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) and supported, the default [`cursor`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) will be `help` instead of `pointer`.

[`icon`](#icon)

Valid with [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), the linked resource represents the icon, a resource for representing the page in the user interface, for the current document.

The most common use for the `icon` value is the favicon:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
If there are multiple ``s, the browser uses their [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#media), [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#type), and [`sizes`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#sizes) attributes to select the most appropriate icon. If several icons are equally appropriate, the last one is used. If the most appropriate icon is later found to be inappropriate, for example because it uses an unsupported format, the browser proceeds to the next\-most appropriate, and so on.

**Note:**
The [`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) attribute is not supported for `rel="icon"` in Chromium\-based browsers. See the [open Chromium issue](https://crbug.com/1121645).

**Note:**
Apple's iOS does not use this link type, nor the [`sizes`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#sizes) attribute, like others mobile browsers do, to select a webpage icon for Web Clip or a start\-up placeholder.
Instead it uses the non\-standard [`apple-touch-icon`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW4) and [`apple-touch-startup-image`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW6) respectively.

**Note:**
The `shortcut` link type is often seen before `icon`, but this link type is non\-conforming, ignored and **web authors must not use it anymore**.

[`license`](#license)

Valid on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) elements, the `license` value indicates that the hyperlink leads to a document describing the licensing information; that the main content of the current document is covered by the copyright license described by the referenced document. If not inside the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) element, the standard doesn't distinguish between a hyperlink applying to a specific part of the document or to the document as a whole. Only the data on the page can indicate this.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`

**Note:**
Although recognized, the synonym `copyright` is incorrect and must be avoided.

[`manifest`](#manifest)

[Web app manifest](/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest). Requires the use of the CORS protocol for cross\-origin fetching.

[`modulepreload`](#modulepreload)

Useful for improved performance, and relevant to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) anywhere in the document, setting `rel="modulepreload"` tells the browser to preemptively fetch the script (and dependencies) and store it in the document's module map for later evaluation. `modulepreload` links can ensure network fetching is done with the module ready (but not evaluated) in the module map before it is necessarily needed. See also [`modulepreload`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/modulepreload).

[`next`](#next)

Relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), the `next` values indicates that the current document is a part of a series, and that the next document in the series is the referenced document. When included in a ``, browsers may assume that document will be fetched next, and treat it as a resource hint.

[`nofollow`](#nofollow)

Relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), the `nofollow` keyword tells search engine spiders to ignore the link relationship. The nofollow relationship may indicate the current document's owner does not endorse the referenced document. It is often included by Search Engine Optimizers pretending their link farms are not spam pages.

[`noopener`](#noopener)

Relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), creates a top\-level browsing context that is not an auxiliary browsing context if the hyperlink would create either of those to begin with (i.e., has an appropriate `target` attribute value). In other words, it makes the link behave as if [`window.opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) were null and `target="_parent"` were set.

This is the opposite of [`opener`](#opener).

[`noreferrer`](#noreferrer)

Relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), including this value makes the referrer unknown (no `Referer` header will be included), and creates a top\-level browsing context as if `noopener` were also set.

[`opener`](#opener)

Creates an auxiliary browsing context if the hyperlink would otherwise create a top\-level browsing context that is not an auxiliary browsing context (i.e., has `"_blank"` as `target` attribute value). Effectively, the opposite of [noopener](#noopener).

[`pingback`](#pingback)

Gives the address of the pingback server that handles pingbacks to the current document. See the [Pingback specification](https://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback).

[`preconnect`](#preconnect)

Provides a hint to the browser suggesting that it open a connection to the linked website in advance, without disclosing any private information or downloading any content, so that when the link is followed the linked content can be fetched more quickly.

[`prefetch`](#prefetch)

Specifies that the user agent should preemptively fetch and cache the target resource as it is likely to be required for a followup navigation.
See [prefetch](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prefetch) for more information.

[`preload`](#preload)

Specifies that the user agent must preemptively fetch and cache the target resource for current navigation according to the potential destination given by the [`as`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#as) attribute (and the priority associated with the corresponding destination). See the page for the [`preload`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload) value.

[`prerender` 
Deprecated

Non\-standard](#prerender)

Specifies that the user agent should preemptively fetch the target resource and process it in a way that helps deliver a faster response in the future, for example by fetching its subresources or performing some rendering.

[`prev`](#prev)

Similar to the [`next`](#next) keyword, relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), the `prev` values indicates that the current document is a part of a series, and that the link references a previous document in the series is the referenced document.

Note: The synonym `previous` is incorrect and should not be used.

[`privacy-policy`](#privacy-policy)

Valid for [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) elements, the `privacy-policy` value indicates that the referenced document is the Privacy Policy which describes the data collection and usage practices of the current document.

[`search`](#search)

Relevant to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements, the `search` keywords indicates that the hyperlink references a document whose interface is specially designed for searching in the current document, site, and related resources, providing a link to a resource that can be used to search.

If the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#type) attribute is set to `application/opensearchdescription+xml` the resource is an [OpenSearch](/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch) plugin that can be easily added to the interface of Firefox.

[`stylesheet`](#stylesheet)

Valid for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) element, it imports an external resource to be used as a stylesheet. The [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#type) attribute is not needed if it's a `text/css` stylesheet, as that is the default value. If it's not a stylesheet of type `text/css` it is best to declare the type.

While this attribute defines the link as being a stylesheet, the interaction with other attributes and other key terms within the rel value impact whether the stylesheet is downloaded and/or used.

When used with the [`alternate`](#alternate) keyword, it defines an alternative style sheet. In this case, include a non\-empty [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#title).

The external stylesheet will not be used or even downloaded if the media does not match the value of the [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#media) attribute.

Requires the use of the CORS protocol for cross\-origin fetching.

[`tag`](#tag)

Valid for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements, it gives a tag (identified by the given address) that applies to the current document. The tag value denotes that the link refers to a document describing a tag applying to the document on which it is located. This link type is not meant for tags within a tag cloud, as those tags apply to a group of pages, whereas the `tag` value of the `rel` attribute is for a single document.

[`terms-of-service`](#terms-of-service)

Valid for [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) elements, the `terms-of-service` value indicates that the referenced document is the Terms of Service that describes the agreements between the current document's provider and users who wish to use the document provided.

## HTML attribute: required - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required)

The [Boolean](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML) **`required`** attribute, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted.

The `required` attribute is supported by `[text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text)`, `[search](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search)`, `[url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url)`, `[tel](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel)`, `[email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email)`, `[password](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password)`, `[date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)`, `[month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month)`, `[week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week)`, `[time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time)`, `[datetime-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local)`, `[number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number)`, `[checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox)`, `[radio](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio)`, `[file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file)`, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) types along with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) form control elements. If present on any of these input types and elements, the [`:required`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:required) pseudo class will match. If the attribute is not included, the [`:optional`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:optional) pseudo class will match.

The attribute is not supported on, or relevant to, [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) and [color](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color) input types, as both have default values. Type `color` defaults to `#000000`. Type `range` defaults to the midpoint between `min` and `max` — with `min` and `max` defaulting to 0 and 100 respectively in most browsers if not declared. `required` is also not supported on the [hidden](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden) input type — users cannot be expected to fill out a hidden form field. Finally, `required` is not supported on any button input types, including [image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image).

In the case of a same named group of [radio](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) buttons, if a single radio button in the group has the `required` attribute, a radio button in that group must be checked, although it doesn't have to be the one on which the attribute is applied. To improve code maintenance, it is recommended to either include the `required` attribute in every same\-named radio button in the group, or else in none.

In the case of a same named group of [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) input types, only the checkboxes with the `required` attribute are required.

**Note:**
Setting [`aria-required="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-required) tells a screen reader that an element (any element) is required, but has no bearing on the optionality of the element.

### [Attribute interactions](#attribute_interactions)

Because a read\-only field cannot be changed, `required` does not have any effect on inputs with the [`readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) attribute also specified.

### [Usability](#usability)

When including the `required` attribute, provide a visible indication near the control informing the user that the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) is required. In addition, target required form controls with the [`:required`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:required) pseudo\-class, styling them in a way to indicate they are required. This improves usability for sighted users. Assistive technology should inform the user that the form control is mandatory based on the required attribute, but adding `aria-required="true"` doesn't hurt, in case the browser / screen reader combination does not support `required` yet.

### [Constraint validation](#constraint_validation)

If the element is required and the element's value is the empty string, then the element is suffering from [`valueMissing`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/valueMissing "valueMissing") and the element will match the [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) pseudo class.

## [Accessibility concerns](#accessibility_concerns)

Provide an indication to users informing them the form control is required. Ensure the messaging is multi\-faceted, such as through text, color, markings, and attribute, so that all users understand the requirements whether they have color blindness, cognitive differences, or are using a screen reader.

## HTML attribute: size - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/size)

The **`size`** attribute defines the width of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) and the height of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element. For an `input` element, it defines the number of characters that the user agent allows the user to see when editing the value. For a `select` element, it defines the number of options that should be shown to the user. This must be a valid non\-negative integer greater than zero.

If no `size` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no size declared, and the form control will be the default width based on the user agent. If CSS targets the element with properties impacting the width, CSS takes precedence.

The `size` attribute has no impact on constraint validation.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Examples](#examples)

By adding `size` on some input types, the width of the input can be controlled. Adding size on a select changes the height, defining how many options are visible in the closed state.

## HTML attribute: step - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/step)

The **`step`** attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to or the keyword `any`. It is valid for the numeric input types, including the [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date), [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month), [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week), [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time), [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local), [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) and [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) types.

The `step` sets the *stepping interval* when clicking up and down spinner buttons, moving a slider left and right on a range, and validating the different date types. If not explicitly included, `step` defaults to 1 for `number` and `range`, and 1 unit type (minute, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value must be a positive number \- integer or float — or the special value `any`, which means no stepping is implied and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min) and [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max)).

The default stepping value for `number` inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, *unless* the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for `time` is 60 seconds, with 900 being equal to 15 minutes.

## [Syntax](#syntax)

 Default values for step

| Input type | Value | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) | 1 (day) | `` |
| [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month) | 1 (month) | `` |
| [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week) | 1 (week) | `` |
| [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time) | 60 (seconds) | `` |
| [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) | 60 (seconds) | `` |
| [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) | 1 | `` |
| [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) | 1 | `` |

If `any` is not explicitly set, valid values for the `number`, date/time input types, and `range` input types are equal to the basis for stepping \- the [`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min) value and increments of the step value, up to the [`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max) value, if specified. The following example results in any even integer, 10 or greater, being valid:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
If `step` is omitted, any integer is valid but floats like 4\.2 are not valid as `step` defaults to 1\. For 4\.2 to be valid:

* either `step` would have to be set to `any`, 0\.1, or 0\.2,
* or the `min` value would have to be a number ending in .2, such as 0\.2, 1\.2, or \-5\.2\.
## [Examples](#examples)

### [`min` impact on step](#min_impact_on_step)

The value of `min` defines valid values, even if the `step` attribute is not included. This is because `step` defaults to `1` for the `number` input type.

In this example, we add a big red border around invalid inputs:

css\`\`\`
input:invalid {
 border: solid red 3px;
}

\`\`\`
We then define an input with a minimum value of 1\.2 and a step value of 2:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
Valid values include 1\.2, 3\.2, 5\.2, 7\.2, 9\.2, 11\.2, and so on. Only floats with an odd\-numbered integer part and a decimal part of .2 are valid. The number spinner, if present, generates valid float values of 1\.2 and greater, in increments of 2\.

**Note:**
When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation and will match the [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) and [`:out-of-range`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:out-of-range) pseudoclasses.

See [Client\-side validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) and [`stepMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/stepMismatch "stepMismatch") for more information.

## [Accessibility concerns](#accessibility_concerns)

Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the `min` attribute, ensure this minimum requirement is understood by the user. Providing instructions within the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) may be sufficient. If providing instructions outside of labels, which allows more flexible positioning and design, consider using [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby).

## <h1>–<h6>: The HTML Section Heading elements - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)

The **``** to **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) elements represent six levels of section headings. `` is the highest section level and `` is the lowest. By default, all heading elements create a [block\-level](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) box in the layout, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

These elements only include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.
* Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) [`font-size`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size) property.
* Do not skip heading levels: always start from ``, followed by `` and so on.
### [Avoid using multiple `` elements on one page](#avoid_using_multiple_h1_elements_on_one_page)

While using multiple `` elements on one page is allowed by the HTML standard (as long as they are not [nested](#nesting)), this is not considered a best practice. A page should generally have a single `` element that describes the content of the page (similar to the document's [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) element).

**Note:**
Nesting multiple `` elements in nested [sectioning elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning) was allowed in older versions of the HTML standard. However, this was never considered a best practice and is now non\-conforming. Read more in [There Is No Document Outline Algorithm](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/08/there-is-no-document-outline-algorithm.html).

Prefer using only one `` per page and [nest headings](#nesting) without skipping levels.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Navigation](#navigation)

A common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is to quickly jump from heading to heading in order to determine the content of the page. Because of this, it is important to not skip one or more heading levels. Doing so may create confusion, as the person navigating this way may be left wondering where the missing heading is.

**Don't do this:**

html\`\`\`
\Heading level 1\
\Heading level 3\
\Heading level 4\

\`\`\`
**Prefer this:**

html\`\`\`
\Heading level 1\
\Heading level 2\
\Heading level 3\

\`\`\`
#### Nesting

Headings may be nested as subsections to reflect the organization of the content of the page. Most screen readers can also generate an ordered list of all the headings on a page, which can help a person quickly determine the content hierarchy and navigate to different headings.

Given the following page structure:

html\`\`\`
\Beetles\

\Etymology\

\Distribution and Diversity\

\Evolution\
\Late Paleozoic\
\Jurassic\
\Cretaceous\
\Cenozoic\

\External Morphology\
\Head\
\Mouthparts\
\Thorax\
\Prothorax\
\Pterothorax\
\Legs\
\Wings\
\Abdomen\

\`\`\`
Screen readers would generate a list like this:

1. `h1` Beetles

	1. `h2` Etymology
	2. `h2` Distribution and Diversity
	3. `h2` Evolution

		1. `h3` Late Paleozoic
		2. `h3` Jurassic
		3. `h3` Cretaceous
		4. `h3` Cenozoic
	4. `h2` External Morphology

		1. `h3` Head

			1. `h4` Mouthparts
		2. `h3` Thorax

			1. `h4` Prothorax
			2. `h4` Pterothorax
		3. `h3` Legs
		4. `h3` Wings
		5. `h3` Abdomen

When headings are nested, heading levels may be "skipped" when closing a subsection.

### [Labeling section content](#labeling_section_content)

Another common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is to generate a list of [sectioning content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning) and use it to determine the page's layout.

Sectioning content can be labeled using a combination of the [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) and [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attributes, with the label concisely describing the purpose of the section. This technique is useful for situations where there is more than one sectioning element on the same page.

#### Sectioning content examples

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \Primary navigation\
 \
 \
\

\

\
 \
 \Footer navigation\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`

In this example, screen reading technology would announce that there are two [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) sections, one called "Primary navigation" and one called "Footer navigation". If labels were not provided, the person using screen reading software may have to investigate each `nav` element's contents to determine their purpose.

## <a>: The Anchor element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element (or *anchor* element), with [its `href` attribute](#href), creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.

Content within each `` *should* indicate the link's destination. If the `href` attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the `` element will activate it.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`attributionsrc` 
Experimental](#attributionsrc)

Specifies that you want the browser to send an [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header. On the server\-side this is used to trigger sending an [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) header in the response, to register a [navigation\-based attribution source](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_sources#navigation-based_attribution_sources).

The browser stores the source data associated with the navigation\-based attribution source (as provided in the [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) response header) when the user clicks the link. See the [Attribution Reporting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API) for more details.

There are two versions of this attribute that you can set:

* Boolean, i.e. just the `attributionsrc` name. This specifies that you want the [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header sent to the same server as the `href` attribute points to. This is fine when you are handling the attribution source registration on the same server.
* Value containing one or more URLs, for example:

html\`\`\`
attributionsrc="https://a.example/register\-source
https://b.example/register\-source"

\`\`\`
This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of `attributionsrc`. When the resource request occurs, the [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in `attributionsrc` in addition to the resource origin. These URLs can then respond with the [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) to complete registration.

**Note:**
Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.

`` elements cannot be used as attribution triggers, only sources.

[`download`](#download)

Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download. Can be used with or without a `filename` value:

* Without a value, the browser will suggest a filename/extension, generated from various sources:

	+ The [`Content-Disposition`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition) HTTP header
	+ The final segment in the URL [path](/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/pathname)
	+ The [media type](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type) (from the [`Content-Type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) header, the start of a [`data:` URL](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/data), or [`Blob.type`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/type) for a [`blob:` URL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL_static))
* `filename`: defining a value suggests it as the filename. `/` and `\` characters are converted to underscores (`_`). Filesystems may forbid other characters in filenames, so browsers will adjust the suggested name if necessary.

**Note:**

* `download` only works for [same\-origin URLs](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy), or the `blob:` and `data:` schemes.
* How browsers treat downloads varies by browser, user settings, and other factors. The user may be prompted before a download starts, or the file may be saved automatically, or it may open automatically, either in an external application or in the browser itself.
* If the `Content-Disposition` header has different information from the `download` attribute, resulting behavior may differ:

	+ If the header specifies a `filename`, it takes priority over a filename specified in the `download` attribute.
	+ If the header specifies a disposition of `inline`, Chrome and Firefox prioritize the attribute and treat it as a download. Old Firefox versions (before 82\) prioritize the header and will display the content inline.

[`href`](#href)

The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to HTTP\-based URLs — they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:

* Telephone numbers with `tel:` URLs
* Email addresses with `mailto:` URLs
* SMS text messages with `sms:` URLs
* Executable code with [`javascript:` URLs](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/javascript)
* While web browsers may not support other URL schemes, websites can with [`registerProtocolHandler()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler)

Moreover other URL features can locate specific parts of the resource, including:

* Sections of a page with document fragments
* Specific text portions with [text fragments](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments)
* Pieces of media files with media fragments

[`hreflang`](#hreflang)

Hints at the human language of the linked URL. No built\-in functionality. Allowed values are the same as [the global `lang` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang).

[`ping`](#ping)

A space\-separated list of URLs. When the link is followed, the browser will send [`POST`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) requests with the body `PING` to the URLs. Typically for tracking.

[`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy)

How much of the [referrer](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) to send when following the link.

* `no-referrer`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent.
* `no-referrer-when-downgrade`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent to [origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin)s without [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) ([HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS)).
* `origin`: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its [scheme](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), [host](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Host), and [port](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Port).
* `origin-when-cross-origin`: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
* `same-origin`: A referrer will be sent for [same origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy), but cross\-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
* `strict-origin`: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (default): Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `unsafe-url`: The referrer will include the origin *and* the path (but not the [fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/hash), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/password), or [username](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/username)). **This value is unsafe**, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS\-protected resources to insecure origins.

[`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel)

The relationship of the linked URL as space\-separated link types.

[`target`](#target)

Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a *browsing context* (a tab, window, or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)). The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:

* `_self`: The current browsing context. (Default)
* `_blank`: Usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.
* `_parent`: The parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as `_self`.
* `_top`: The topmost browsing context. To be specific, this means the "highest" context that's an ancestor of the current one. If no ancestors, behaves as `_self`.
* `_unfencedTop`: Allows embedded [fenced frames](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API) to navigate the top\-level frame (i.e. traversing beyond the root of the fenced frame, unlike other reserved destinations). Note that the navigation will still succeed if this is used outside of a fenced frame context, but it will not act like a reserved keyword.

**Note:**
Setting `target="_blank"` on `` elements implicitly provides the same `rel` behavior as setting [`rel="noopener"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noopener) which does not set `window.opener`.

[`type`](#type)

Hints at the linked URL's format with a [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type). No built\-in functionality.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

[`charset` 
Deprecated](#charset)

Hinted at the [character encoding](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_encoding) of the linked URL.

**Note:**
This attribute is deprecated and **should not be used by authors**. Use the HTTP [`Content-Type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) header on the linked URL.

[`coords` 
Deprecated](#coords)

Used with [the `shape` attribute](#shape). A comma\-separated list of coordinates.

[`name` 
Deprecated](#name)

Was required to define a possible target location in a page. In HTML 4\.01, `id` and `name` could both be used on ``, as long as they had identical values.

**Note:**
Use the global attribute [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) instead.

[`rev` 
Deprecated](#rev)

Specified a reverse link; the opposite of [the `rel` attribute](#rel). Deprecated for being very confusing.

[`shape` 
Deprecated](#shape)

The shape of the hyperlink's region in an image map.

**Note:**
Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) element for image maps instead.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Strong link text](#strong_link_text)

**The content inside a link should indicate where the link goes**, even out of context.

#### Inaccessible, weak link text

A sadly common mistake is to only link the words "click here" or "here":

html\`\`\`
\Learn more about our products \here\.\

\`\`\`
##### Result

#### Strong link text

Luckily, this is an easy fix, and it's actually shorter than the inaccessible version!

html\`\`\`
\Learn more \about our products\.\

\`\`\`
##### Result

Assistive software has shortcuts to list all links on a page. However, strong link text benefits all users — the "list all links" shortcut emulates how sighted users quickly scan pages.

### [onclick events](#onclick_events)

Anchor elements are often abused as fake buttons by setting their `href` to `#` or [`javascript:void(0)`](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/javascript) to prevent the page from refreshing, then listening for their `click` events.

These bogus `href` values cause unexpected behavior when copying/dragging links, opening links in a new tab/window, bookmarking, or when JavaScript is loading, errors, or is disabled. They also convey incorrect semantics to assistive technologies, like screen readers.

Use a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) instead. In general, **you should only use a hyperlink for navigation to a real URL**.

### [External links and linking to non\-HTML resources](#external_links_and_linking_to_non-html_resources)

Links that open in a new tab/window via `target="_blank"`, or links that point to a download file should indicate what will happen when the link is followed.

People experiencing low vision conditions, navigating with the aid of screen reading technology, or with cognitive concerns may be confused when a new tab, window, or application opens unexpectedly. Older screen\-reading software may not even announce the behavior.

#### Link that opens a new tab/window

html\`\`\`
\
 Wikipedia (opens in new tab)
\

\`\`\`
##### Result

#### Link to a non\-HTML resource

If an icon is used to signify link behavior, make sure it has an [`alt` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#alt) to describe its purpose. In case the icon is missing, the `alt` attribute's content will still convey the link's behavior.

### [Skip links](#skip_links)

A **skip link** is a link placed as early as possible in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) content that points to the beginning of the page's main content. Usually, CSS hides a skip link offscreen until focused.

html\`\`\`
\
 \Skip to main content\

 \…\

 \
 \\
\

\`\`\`
css\`\`\`
.skip\-link {
 position: absolute;
 top: \-3em;
 background: \#fff;
}
.skip\-link:focus {
 top: 0;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

Skip links let keyboard users bypass content repeated throughout multiple pages, such as header navigation.

Skip links are especially useful for people who navigate with the aid of assistive technology such as switch control, voice command, or mouth sticks/head wands, where the act of moving through repetitive links can be laborious.

### [Size and proximity](#size_and_proximity)

#### Size

Interactive elements, like links, should provide an area large enough that it is easy to activate them. This helps a variety of people, including those with motor control issues and those using imprecise inputs such as a touchscreen. A minimum size of 44×44 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-css-pixels) is recommended.

Text\-only links in prose content are exempt from this requirement, but it's still a good idea to make sure enough text is hyperlinked to be easily activated.

* [Quick test: Large touch targets](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/large-touch-targets/)

#### Proximity

Interactive elements, like links, placed in close visual proximity should have space separating them. Spacing helps people with motor control issues, who may otherwise accidentally activate the wrong interactive content.

Spacing may be created using CSS properties like [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin).

### [Linking to an email address](#linking_to_an_email_address)

To create links that open in the user's email program to let them send a new message, use the `mailto:` scheme:

html\`\`\`
\Send email to nowhere\

\`\`\`
#### Result

For details about `mailto:` URLs, such as including a subject or body, see [Email links](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links#email_links) or [RFC 6068](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6068).

`tel:` link behavior varies with device capabilities:

* Cellular devices autodial the number.
* Most operating systems have programs that can make calls, like Skype or FaceTime.
* Websites can make phone calls with [`registerProtocolHandler`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler "registerProtocolHandler"), such as `web.skype.com`.
* Other behaviors include saving the number to contacts, or sending the number to another device.

See [RFC 3966](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3966) for syntax, additional features, and other details about the `tel:` URL scheme.

### [Using the download attribute to save a \ as a PNG](#using_the_download_attribute_to_save_a_canvas_as_a_png)

To save a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element's contents as an image, you can create a link where the `href` is the canvas data as a `data:` URL created with JavaScript and the `download` attribute provides the file name for the downloaded PNG file:

#### Example painting app with save link

##### HTML

html\`\`\`
\

## [Security and privacy](#security_and_privacy)

`` elements can have consequences for users' security and privacy. See [`Referer` header: privacy and security concerns](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns) for information.

Using `target="_blank"` without [`rel="noreferrer"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noreferrer) and [`rel="noopener"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noopener) makes the website vulnerable to [`window.opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) API exploitation attacks, although note that, in newer browser versions setting `target="_blank"` implicitly provides the same protection as setting `rel="noopener"`. See [browser compatibility](#browser_compatibility) for details.

## <abbr>: The Abbreviation element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an abbreviation or acronym.

When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the `` to mark up the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.

The optional [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means. If present, `title` must contain this full description and nothing else.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes). The [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) attribute has a specific semantic meaning when used with the `` element; it *must* contain a full human\-readable description or expansion of the abbreviation. This text is often presented by browsers as a tooltip when the mouse cursor is hovered over the element.

Each `` element you use is independent of all others; providing a `title` for one does not automatically attach the same expansion text to others with the same content text.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

### [Typical use cases](#typical_use_cases)

It's certainly not required that all abbreviations be marked up using ``. There are, though, a few cases where it's helpful to do so:

* When an abbreviation is used and you want to provide an expansion or definition outside the flow of the document's content, use `` with an appropriate [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title).
* To define an abbreviation which may be unfamiliar to the reader, present the term using `` and inline text providing the definition. Include a `title` attribute only when the inline expansion or definition is not available.
* When an abbreviation's presence in the text needs to be semantically noted, the `` element is useful. This can be used, in turn, for styling or scripting purposes.
* You can use `` in concert with [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dfn) to establish definitions for terms which are abbreviations or acronyms. See the example [Defining an abbreviation](#defining_an_abbreviation) below.
### [Grammar considerations](#grammar_considerations)

In languages with [grammatical number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number) (that is, languages where the number of items affects the grammar of a sentence), use the same grammatical number in your `title` attribute as inside your `` element. This is especially important in languages with more than two numbers, such as Arabic, but is also relevant in English.

## [Default styling](#default_styling)

The purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author and all browsers display it inline ([`display: inline`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)) by default, though its default styling varies from one browser to another:

Some browsers add a dotted underline to the content of the element. Others add a dotted underline while converting the contents to small caps. Others may not style it differently than a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element. To control this styling, use [`text-decoration`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration) and [`font-variant`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant).

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Spelling out the acronym or abbreviation in full the first time it is used on a page is beneficial for helping people understand it, especially if the content is technical or industry jargon.

Only include a `title` if expanding the abbreviation or acronym in the text is not possible. Having a difference between the announced word or phrase and what is displayed on the screen, especially if it's technical jargon the reader may not be familiar with, can be jarring.

 JavaScript Object Notation (\JSON\) is a lightweight
 data\-interchange format.

\`\`\`

This is especially helpful for people who are unfamiliar with the terminology or concepts discussed in the content, people who are new to the language, and people with cognitive concerns.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Marking up an abbreviation semantically](#marking_up_an_abbreviation_semantically)

To mark up an abbreviation without providing an expansion or description, use `` without any attributes, as seen in this example.

## <acronym> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/acronym)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word.

**Warning:**
Don't use this element. Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr) element instead.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only has [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes), which are common to all elements.

## [DOM Interface](#dom_interface)

This element implements the [`HTMLElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) interface.

## [Default styling](#default_styling)

Though the purpose of this tag is purely for the convenience of the author, its default styling varies from one browser to another:

* Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and some others add a dotted underline to the content of the element.
* A few browsers not only add a dotted underline, but also put it in small caps; to avoid this styling, adding something like [`font-variant: none`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant) in the CSS takes care of this case.

It is therefore recommended that web authors either explicitly style this element, or accept some cross\-browser variation.

## <address>: The Contact Address element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.

## [Try it](#try_it)

The contact information provided by an `` element's contents can take whatever form is appropriate for the context, and may include any type of contact information that is needed, such as a physical address, URL, email address, phone number, social media handle, geographic coordinates, and so forth. The `` element should include the name of the person, people, or organization to which the contact information refers.

`` can be used in a variety of contexts, such as providing a business's contact information in the page header, or indicating the author of an article by including an `` element within the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article).

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` element can only be used to represent the contact information for its nearest [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) element ancestor.
* This element should not contain more information than the contact information, like a publication date (which belongs in a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) element).
* Typically an `` element can be placed inside the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer) element of the current section, if any.
## [Examples](#examples)

This example demonstrates the use of `` to demarcate the contact information for an article's author.

html\`\`\`
\
 You can contact author at
 \www.example.com\.\
 If you see any bugs, please
 \contact webmaster\.\
 You may also want to visit us:\
 Mozilla Foundation\
 331 E Evelyn Ave\
 Mountain View, CA 94041\
 USA
\

\`\`\`### [Result](#result)

Although it renders text with the same default styling as the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) elements, it is more appropriate to use `` when dealing with contact information, as it conveys additional semantic information.

## <area>: The Image Map Area element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An *image map* allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with [hypertext links](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hyperlink).

This element is used only within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`alt`](#alt)

A text string alternative to display on browsers that do not display images.
The text should be phrased so that it presents the user with the same kind of choice as the image would offer when displayed without the alternative text.
This attribute is required only if the [`href`](#href) attribute is used.

[`coords`](#coords)

The `coords` attribute details the coordinates of the [`shape`](#shape) attribute in size, shape, and placement of an ``.
This attribute must not be used if `shape` is set to `default`.

* `rect`: the value is `x1,y1,x2,y2`.
The value specifies the coordinates of the top\-left and bottom\-right corner of the rectangle.
For example, in `` the coordinates are `0,0` and `253,27`, indicating the top\-left and bottom\-right corners of the rectangle, respectively.
* `circle`: the value is `x,y,radius`. Value specifies the coordinates of the circle center and the radius.
For example: ``
* `poly`: the value is `x1,y1,x2,y2,..,xn,yn`. Value specifies the coordinates of the edges of the polygon.
If the first and last coordinate pairs are not the same, the browser will add the last coordinate pair to close the polygon

The values are numbers of CSS pixels.

[`download`](#download)

This attribute, if present, indicates that the linked resource is intended to be downloaded rather than displayed in the browser.
See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) for a full description of the [`download`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#download) attribute.

[`href`](#href)

The hyperlink target for the area.
Its value is a valid URL.
This attribute may be omitted; if so, the `` element does not represent a hyperlink.

[`ping`](#ping)

Contains a space\-separated list of URLs to which, when the hyperlink is followed, [`POST`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) requests with the body `PING` will be sent by the browser (in the background).
Typically used for tracking.

[`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy)

A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource:

* `no-referrer`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent.
* `no-referrer-when-downgrade`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent to [origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin)s without [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) ([HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS)).
* `origin`: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its [scheme](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), [host](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Host), and [port](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Port).
* `origin-when-cross-origin`: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
* `same-origin`: A referrer will be sent for [same origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy), but cross\-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
* `strict-origin`: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (default): Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `unsafe-url`: The referrer will include the origin *and* the path (but not the [fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/hash), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/password), or [username](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/username)).
**This value is unsafe**, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS\-protected resources to insecure origins.

[`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel)

For anchors containing the [`href`](#href) attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the target object to the link object.
The value is a space\-separated list of link types.
The values and their semantics will be registered by some authority that might have meaning to the document author.
The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the [`href`](#href) attribute is present.

[`shape`](#shape)

The shape of the associated hot spot. The specifications for HTML defines the values `rect`, which defines a rectangular region; `circle`, which defines a circular region; `poly`, which defines a polygon; and `default`, which indicates the entire region beyond any defined shapes.

[`target`](#target)

A keyword or author\-defined name of the [browsing context](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context) to display the linked resource.
The following keywords have special meanings:

* `_self` (default): Show the resource in the current browsing context.
* `_blank`: Show the resource in a new, unnamed browsing context.
* `_parent`: Show the resource in the parent browsing context of the current one, if the current page is inside a frame.
If there is no parent, acts the same as `_self`.
* `_top`: Show the resource in the topmost browsing context (the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has no parent).
If there is no parent, acts the same as `_self`.

Use this attribute only if the [`href`](#href) attribute is present.

**Note:**
Setting `target="_blank"` on `` elements implicitly provides the same `rel` behavior as setting [`rel="noopener"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noopener) which does not set `window.opener`. See [browser compatibility](#browser_compatibility) for support status.

## <article>: The Article Contents element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a self\-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user\-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

## [Try it](#try_it)

A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an `` element, possibly with one or more ``s within.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Each `` should be identified, typically by including a heading ([`` \- ``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) element) as a child of the `` element.
* When an `` element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be `` elements nested in the `` representing the blog post.
* Author information of an `` element can be provided through the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address) element, but it doesn't apply to nested `` elements.
* The publication date and time of an `` element can be described using the [`datetime`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time#datetime) attribute of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) element.

It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the `src` attribute or the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a [`MediaStream`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream).

## [Try it](#try_it)

The above example shows basic usage of the `` element. In a similar manner to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element, we include a path to the media we want to embed inside the `src` attribute; we can include other attributes to specify information such as whether we want it to autoplay and loop, whether we want to show the browser's default audio controls, etc.

The content inside the opening and closing `` tags is shown as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`autoplay`](#autoplay)

A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the entire audio file to finish downloading.

**Note:**
Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you should make it opt\-in (requiring a user to specifically enable it). However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose source will be set at a later time, under user control. See our [autoplay guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide) for additional information about how to properly use autoplay.

[`controls`](#controls)

If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control audio playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.

[`controlslist`](#controlslist)

The [`controlslist`](https://wicg.github.io/controls-list/explainer.html) attribute, when specified, helps the browser select what controls to show for the `audio` element whenever the browser shows its own set of controls (that is, when the `controls` attribute is specified).

The allowed values are `nodownload`, `nofullscreen` and `noremoteplayback`.

[`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin)

This [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related audio file. [CORS\-enabled resources](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image) can be reused in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element without being *tainted*. The allowed values are:

[`anonymous`](#anonymous)

Sends a cross\-origin request without a credential. In other words, it sends the `Origin:` HTTP header without a cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:` HTTP header), the resource will be *tainted*, and its usage restricted.

[`use-credentials`](#use-credentials)

Sends a cross\-origin request with a credential. In other words, it sends the `Origin:` HTTP header with a cookie, a certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:` HTTP header), the resource will be *tainted* and its usage restricted.

When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the `Origin:` HTTP header), preventing its non\-tainted use in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword **anonymous** was used. See [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) for additional information.

[`disableremoteplayback`](#disableremoteplayback)

A Boolean attribute used to disable the capability of remote playback in devices that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI, etc.) and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, etc.). See [this proposed specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/remote-playback/#the-disableremoteplayback-attribute) for more information.

In Safari, you can use [`x-webkit-airplay="deny"`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AirPlayGuide/OptingInorOutofAirPlay/OptingInorOutofAirPlay.html) as a fallback.

[`loop`](#loop)

A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio player will automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the audio.

[`muted`](#muted)

A Boolean attribute that indicates whether the audio will be initially silenced. Its default value is `false`.

[`preload`](#preload)

This [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:

* `none`: Indicates that the audio should not be preloaded.
* `metadata`: Indicates that only audio metadata (e.g. length) is fetched.
* `auto`: Indicates that the whole audio file can be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it.
* *empty string*: A synonym of the `auto` value.

The default value is different for each browser. The spec advises it to be set to `metadata`.

**Note:**

* The `autoplay` attribute has precedence over `preload`. If `autoplay` is specified, the browser would obviously need to start downloading the audio for playback.
* The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.

[`src`](#src)

The URL of the audio to embed. This is subject to [HTTP access controls](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). This is optional; you may instead use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) element within the audio block to specify the audio to embed.

## [Events](#events)

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

Browsers don't all support the same [file types](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers) and [audio codecs](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs); you can provide multiple sources inside nested [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) elements, and the browser will then use the first one it understands:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \
 Download \MP3\ or
 \OGG\ audio.
 \
\

\`\`\`
The audio source can be set to any valid [URL](/en-US/docs/Web/URI), including HTTP(S) URLs and [Data URLs](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/data). When using HTTP(S) URLs, be aware that the browser's caching behavior will affect how often the file is requested from the server. Data URLs embed the audio data directly in the HTML, which can be useful for small audio files but isn't recommended for larger files as it increases the HTML file size.

You can also use the [Web Audio API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to directly generate and manipulate audio streams from JavaScript code rather than streaming pre\-existing audio files. You can set the [`srcObject`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/srcObject) in JavaScript to a [`MediaStream`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) object. This is commonly used for live audio streams or real\-time audio processing.

js\`\`\`
const audioElement = document.querySelector("audio");
navigator.mediaDevices
 .getUserMedia({ audio: true })
 .then((stream) =\> {
 audioElement.srcObject = stream;
 })
 .catch((error) =\> {
 console.error("Error accessing the microphone", error);
 });

\`\`\`
Note that `MediaStream` sources have limitations: they are not seekable and only support a limited set of codecs.

We offer a substantive and thorough [guide to media file types](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats) and the [audio codecs that can be used within them](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs). Also available is [a guide to the codecs supported for video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs).

Other usage notes:

* If you don't specify the `controls` attribute, the audio player won't include the browser's default controls. You can, however, create your own custom controls using JavaScript and the [`HTMLMediaElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) API.
* To allow precise control over your audio content, `HTMLMediaElement`s fire many different [events](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement#events). This also provides a way to monitor the audio's fetching process so you can watch for errors or detect when enough is available to begin to play or manipulate it.
* `` elements can't have subtitles or captions associated with them in the same way that `` elements can. See [WebVTT and Audio](https://www.iandevlin.com/blog/2015/12/html5/webvtt-and-audio/) by Ian Devlin for some useful information and workarounds.
* To test the fallback content on browsers that support the element, you can replace `` with a non\-existing element like ``.

A good general source of information on using HTML `` is the [HTML video and audio](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_video_and_audio) beginner's tutorial.

### [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

The `` element has no intrinsic visual output of its own unless the `controls` attribute is specified, in which case the browser's default controls are shown.

The default controls have a [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) value of `inline` by default, and it is often a good idea to set the value to `block` to improve control over positioning and layout, unless you want it to sit within a text block or similar.

You can style the default controls with properties that affect the block as a single unit, so for example you can give it a [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) and [`border-radius`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius), [`padding`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding), [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin), etc. You can't however style the individual components inside the audio player (e.g. change the button size or icons, change the font, etc.), and the controls are different across the different browsers.

To get a consistent look and feel across browsers, you'll need to create custom controls; these can be marked up and styled in whatever way you want, and then JavaScript can be used along with the [`HTMLMediaElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) API to wire up their functionality.

[Video player styling basics](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery/Video_player_styling_basics) provides some useful styling techniques — it is written in the context of ``, but much of it is equally applicable to ``.

### [Detecting addition and removal of tracks](#detecting_addition_and_removal_of_tracks)

You can detect when tracks are added to and removed from an `` element using the [`addtrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioTrackList/addtrack_event "addtrack") and [`removetrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioTrackList/removetrack_event "removetrack") events. However, these events aren't sent directly to the `` element itself. Instead, they're sent to the track list object within the `` element's [`HTMLMediaElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) that corresponds to the type of track that was added to the element:

[`HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/audioTracks)

An [`AudioTrackList`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioTrackList) containing all of the media element's audio tracks. You can add a listener for `addtrack` to this object to be alerted when new audio tracks are added to the element.

[`HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/videoTracks)

Add an `addtrack` listener to this [`VideoTrackList`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoTrackList) object to be informed when video tracks are added to the element.

[`HTMLMediaElement.textTracks`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/textTracks)

Add an `addtrack` event listener to this [`TextTrackList`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextTrackList) to be notified when new text tracks are added to the element.

**Note:**
Even though it's an `` element, it still has video and text track lists, and can in fact be used to present video, although the user interface implications can be odd.

For example, to detect when audio tracks are added to or removed from an `` element, you can use code like this:

js\`\`\`
const elem = document.querySelector("audio");

elem.audioTrackList.onaddtrack = (event) =\> {
 trackEditor.addTrack(event.track);
};

elem.audioTrackList.onremovetrack = (event) =\> {
 trackEditor.removeTrack(event.track);
};

\`\`\`
This code watches for audio tracks to be added to and removed from the element, and calls a hypothetical function on a track editor to register and remove the track from the editor's list of available tracks.

You can also use [`addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener "addEventListener()") to listen for the [`addtrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioTrackList/addtrack_event "addtrack") and [`removetrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioTrackList/removetrack_event "removetrack") events.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Audio with spoken dialog should provide both captions and transcripts that accurately describe its content. Captions, which are specified using [WebVTT](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API), allow people who are hearing impaired to understand an audio recording's content as the recording is being played, while transcripts allow people who need additional time to be able to review the recording's content at a pace and format that is comfortable for them.

If automatic captioning services are used, it is important to review the generated content to ensure it accurately represents the source audio.

The `` element doesn't directly support WebVTT. You will have to find a library or framework that provides the capability for you, or write the code to display captions yourself. One option is to play your audio using a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element, which does support WebVTT.

In addition to spoken dialog, subtitles and transcripts should also identify music and sound effects that communicate important information. This includes emotion and tone. For example, in the WebVTT below, note the use of square brackets to provide tone and emotional insight to the viewer; this can help establish the mood otherwise provided using music, nonverbal sounds and crucial sound effects, and so forth.

\[Laughing] Sorry! I mean, which wristwatch is a Swiss wristwatch?

\`\`\`
Also it's a good practice to provide some content (such as the direct download link) as a fallback for viewers who use a browser in which the `` element is not supported:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \
 Download \MP3\ or
 \OGG\ audio.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic usage](#basic_usage)

The following example shows basic usage of the `` element to play an OGG file. It will autoplay due to the `autoplay` attribute—if the page has permission to do so—and also includes fallback content.

html\`\`\`
\
\
 \Download OGG audio\.
\

\`\`\`
For details on when autoplay works, how to get permission to use autoplay, and how and when it's appropriate to use autoplay, see our [autoplay guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide).

### [\ element with \ element](#audio_element_with_source_element)

This example specifies which audio track to embed using the `src` attribute on a nested `` element rather than directly on the `` element. It is always useful to include the file's MIME type inside the `type` attribute, as the browser is able to instantly tell if it can play that file, and not waste time on it if not.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \Download WAV audio\.
\

\`\`\`### [\ with multiple \ elements](#audio_with_multiple_source_elements)

This example includes multiple `` elements. The browser tries to load the first source element (Opus) if it is able to play it; if not it falls back to the second (Vorbis) and finally back to MP3:

## <b>: The Bring Attention To element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use `` for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS [`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Use the `` for cases like keywords in a summary, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical presentation would be boldfaced (but not including any special importance).
* Do not confuse the `` element with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark) elements. The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) element represents text of certain *importance*, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) puts some emphasis on the text and the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark) element represents text of certain *relevance*. The `` element doesn't convey such special semantic information; use it only when no others fit.
* Similarly, do not mark titles and headings using the `` element. For this purpose, use the [h1](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) to [h6](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) tags. Further, stylesheets can change the default style of these elements, with the result that they are not *necessarily* displayed in bold.
* It is a good practice to use the [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) attribute on the `` element in order to convey additional semantic information as needed (for example `` for the first sentence in a paragraph). This makes it easier to manage multiple use cases of `` if your stylistic needs change, without the need to change all of its uses in the HTML.
* Historically, the `` element was meant to make text boldface. Styling information has been deprecated since HTML4, so the meaning of the `` element has been changed.
* If there is no semantic purpose to using the `` element, you should use the CSS [`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) property with the value `"bold"` instead in order to make text bold.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies the base URL to use for all *relative* URLs in a document. There can be only one `` element in a document.

A document's used base URL can be accessed by scripts with [`Node.baseURI`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/baseURI). If the document has no `` elements, then `baseURI` defaults to [`location.href`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/href).

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

**Warning:**
A `` element must have an `href` attribute, a `target` attribute, or both.
If at least one of these attributes are specified, the `` element **must** come before other elements with attribute values that are URLs, such as a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)'s `href` attribute.

[`href`](#href)

The base URL to be used throughout the document for relative URLs.
Absolute and relative URLs are allowed.
[`data:`](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/data) and [`javascript:`](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Schemes/javascript) URLs are not allowed.

[`target`](#target)

A **keyword** or **author\-defined name** of the default [browsing context](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context) to show the results of navigation from [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) elements without explicit `target` attributes. The following keywords have special meanings:

* `_self` (default): Show the result in the current browsing context.
* `_blank`: Show the result in a new, unnamed browsing context.
* `_parent`: Show the result in the parent browsing context of the current one, if the current page is inside a frame. If there is no parent, acts the same as `_self`.
* `_top`: Show the result in the topmost browsing context (the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has no parent). If there is no parent, acts the same as `_self`.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

### [Multiple \ elements](#multiple_base_elements)

If multiple `` elements are used, only the first `href` and first `target` are obeyed — all others are ignored.

### [In\-page anchors](#in-page_anchors)

Links pointing to a fragment in the document — e.g. `` — are resolved with the ``, triggering an HTTP request to the base URL with the fragment attached.

For example, given `` and this link: `[To anchor](#anchor)`. The link points to `https://example.com/#anchor`.

### [target may not contain ASCII newline, tab, or \`, and should always have full absolute URLs. For example:

## <bdi>: The Bidirectional Isolate element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bdi)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.

## [Try it](#try_it)

Bidirectional text is text that may contain both sequences of characters that are arranged left\-to\-right (LTR) and sequences of characters that are arranged right\-to\-left (RTL), such as an Arabic quotation embedded in an English string. Browsers implement the [Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics) to handle this. In this algorithm, characters are given an implicit directionality: for example, Latin characters are treated as LTR while Arabic characters are treated as RTL. Some other characters (such as spaces and some punctuation) are treated as neutral and are assigned directionality based on that of their surrounding characters.

Usually, the bidirectional algorithm will do the right thing without the author having to provide any special markup but, occasionally, the algorithm needs help. That's where `` comes in.

The `` element is used to wrap a span of text and instructs the bidirectional algorithm to treat this text in isolation from its surroundings. This works in two ways:

* The directionality of text embedded in `` *does not influence* the directionality of the surrounding text.
* The directionality of text embedded in `` *is not influenced by* the directionality of the surrounding text.

For example, consider some text like:

\`\`\`
EMBEDDED\-TEXT \- 1st place

\`\`\`
If `EMBEDDED-TEXT` is LTR, this works fine. But if `EMBEDDED-TEXT` is RTL, then `- 1` will be treated as RTL text (because it consists of neutral and weak characters). The result will be garbled:

\`\`\`
1 \- EMBEDDED\-TEXTst place

\`\`\`
If you know the directionality of `EMBEDDED-TEXT` in advance, you can fix this problem by wrapping `EMBEDDED-TEXT` in a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) with the [`dir`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir) attribute set to the known directionality. But if you don't know the directionality \- for example, because `EMBEDDED-TEXT` is being read from a database or entered by the user \- you should use `` to prevent the directionality of `EMBEDDED-TEXT` from affecting its surroundings.

Though the same visual effect can be achieved using the CSS rule [`unicode-bidi: isolate`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unicode-bidi) on a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) or another text\-formatting element, HTML authors should not use this approach because it is not semantic and browsers are allowed to ignore CSS styling.

Embedding the characters in `` has the same effect as using ``, but its semantics are less clear.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes), except that the [`dir`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir) attribute behaves differently than normal: it defaults to `auto`, meaning its value is never inherited from the parent element. This means that unless you specify a value of either `rtl` or `ltr` for `dir`, the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) will determine the correct directionality to use based on the contents of the ``.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [No bdi with only LTR](#no_bdi_with_only_ltr)

This example lists the winners of a competition using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) elements only. When the names only contain LTR text the results look fine:

html\`\`\`
\
 \\Henrietta Boffin\ \- 1st place\
 \\Jerry Cruncher\ \- 2nd place\
\

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
body {
 border: 1px solid \#3f87a6;
 max\-width: calc(100% \- 40px \- 6px);
 padding: 20px;
 width: calc(100% \- 40px \- 6px);
 border\-width: 1px 1px 1px 5px;
}

\`\`\`
### [No bdi with RTL text](#no_bdi_with_rtl_text)

This example lists the winners of a competition using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) elements only, and one of the winners has a name consisting of RTL text. In this case the `- 1`, which consists of characters with neutral or weak directionality, will adopt the directionality of the RTL text, and the result will be garbled:

html\`\`\`
\
 \\اَلأَعْشَى\ \- 1st place\
 \\Jerry Cruncher\ \- 2nd place\
\

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
body {
 border: 1px solid \#3f87a6;
 max\-width: calc(100% \- 40px \- 6px);
 padding: 20px;
 width: calc(100% \- 40px \- 6px);
 border\-width: 1px 1px 1px 5px;
}

\`\`\`
### [Using bdi with LTR and RTL text](#using_bdi_with_ltr_and_rtl_text)

This example lists the winners of a competition using `` elements. These elements instruct the browser to treat the name in isolation from its embedding context, so the example output is properly ordered:

html\`\`\`
\
 \\اَلأَعْشَى\ \- 1st place\
 \\Jerry Cruncher\ \- 2nd place\
\

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
body {
 border: 1px solid \#3f87a6;
 max\-width: calc(100% \- 40px \- 6px);
 padding: 20px;
 width: calc(100% \- 40px \- 6px);
 border\-width: 1px 1px 1px 5px;
}

## <bdo>: The Bidirectional Text Override element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/bdo)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.

## [Try it](#try_it)

The text's characters are drawn from the starting point in the given direction; the individual characters' orientation is not affected (so characters don't get drawn backward, for example).

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`dir`](#dir)

The direction in which text should be rendered in this element's contents. Possible values are:

* `ltr`: Indicates that the text should go in a left\-to\-right direction.
* `rtl`: Indicates that the text should go in a right\-to\-left direction.

## [Examples](#examples)

html\`\`\`
\
\This text will go left to right.\
\\This text will go right to left.\\

\`\`\`### [Result](#result)

## [Notes](#notes)

The HTML 4 specification did not specify events for this element; they were added in XHTML. This is most likely an oversight.

## <big>: The Bigger Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/big)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) deprecated element renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (`medium` becomes `large`, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.

**Warning:**
This element has been removed from the specification and shouldn't be used anymore. Use the CSS [`font-size`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size) property to adjust the font size.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element has no other attributes than the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes), common to all elements.

## [Examples](#examples)

Here we see examples showing the use of `` followed by an example showing how to accomplish the same results using modern CSS syntax instead.

### [Using big](#using_big)

## <blockquote>: The Block Quotation element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see [Notes](#usage_notes) for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the `cite` attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite) element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`cite`](#cite)

A URL that designates a source document or message for the information quoted. This attribute is intended to point to information explaining the context or the reference for the quote.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

According to the specification, attribution for the quotation, if any, must be placed outside the `` element.

To change the indentation applied to the quoted text, use the [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) [`margin-left`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-left) and/or [`margin-right`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-right) properties, or the [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) shorthand property.

To include shorter quotes inline rather than in a separate block, use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q) (Quotation) element.

## [Examples](#examples)

This example demonstrates the use of the `` element to quote a passage from [RFC 1149](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1149), *A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers*.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
 service. The connection topology is limited to a single point\-to\-point path
 for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
 without significant interference with each other, outside early spring. This
 is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to
 the 1D ether used by IEEE802\.3\. The carriers have an intrinsic collision
 avoidance system, which increases availability.

## <br>: The Line Break element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element produces a line break in text (carriage\-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.

## [Try it](#try_it)

As you can see from the above example, a `` element is included at each point where we want the text to break. The text after the `` begins again at the start of the next line of the text block.

**Note:**
Do not use `` to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) elements and use the [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) property to control their size.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

[`clear` 
Deprecated](#clear)

Indicates where to begin the next line after the break.

## [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

The `` element has a single, well\-defined purpose — to create a line break in a block of text. As such, it has no dimensions or visual output of its own, and there is very little you can do to style it.

You can set a [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) on `` elements themselves to increase the spacing between the lines of text in the block, but this is a bad practice — you should use the [`line-height`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height) property that was designed for that purpose.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Creating separate paragraphs of text using `` is not only bad practice, it is problematic for people who navigate with the aid of screen reading technology. Screen readers may announce the presence of the element, but not any content contained within ``s. This can be a confusing and frustrating experience for the person using the screen reader.

Use `` elements, and use CSS properties like [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) to control their spacing.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic br](#basic_br)

In the following example we use `` elements to create line breaks between the different lines of a postal address:

## <button>: The Button element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a [form](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms) or opening a dialog.

By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`autofocus`](#autofocus)

This Boolean attribute specifies that the button should have input [focus](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) when the page loads. **Only one element in a document can have this attribute.**

[`command` 
Experimental](#command)

Specifies the action to be performed on an element being controlled by a control ``, specified via the `commandfor` attribute. The possible values are:

[`"show-modal"`](#show-modal)

The button will show a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) as modal. If the dialog is already modal, no action will be taken.

[`"close"`](#close)

The button will close a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) element. If the dialog is already closed, no action will be taken.

[`"show-popover"`](#show-popover)

The button will show a hidden popover. If you try to show an already showing popover, no action will be taken. See [Popover API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API "Popover API") for more details.

[`"hide-popover"`](#hide-popover)

The button will hide a showing popover. If you try to hide an already hidden popover, no action will be taken. See [Popover API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API "Popover API") for more details.

[`"toggle-popover"`](#toggle-popover)

The button will toggle a popover between showing and hidden. If the popover is hidden, it will be shown; if the popover is showing, it will be hidden. See [Popover API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API "Popover API") for more details.

[Custom values](#custom_values)

This attribute can represent custom values that are prefixed with a two hyphen characters (`--`). Buttons with a custom value will dispatch the [`CommandEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CommandEvent) on the controlled element.

[`commandfor` 
Experimental](#commandfor)

Turns a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) element into a button, controlling the given interactive element; takes the ID of the element to control as its value.

[`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)

This Boolean attribute prevents the user from interacting with the button: it cannot be pressed or focused.

[`form`](#form)

The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element to associate the button with (its *form owner*). The value of this attribute must be the `id` of a `` in the same document. (If this attribute is not set, the `` is associated with its ancestor `` element, if any.)

This attribute lets you associate `` elements to ``s anywhere in the document, not just inside a ``. It can also override an ancestor `` element.

[`formaction`](#formaction)

The URL that processes the information submitted by the button. Overrides the [`action`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#action) attribute of the button's form owner. Does nothing if there is no form owner.

[`formenctype`](#formenctype)

If the button is a submit button (it's inside/associated with a `` and doesn't have `type="button"`), specifies how to encode the form data that is submitted. Possible values:

* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: The default if the attribute is not used.
* `multipart/form-data`: Used to submit [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements with their [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#type) attributes set to `file`.
* `text/plain`: Specified as a debugging aid; shouldn't be used for real form submission.

If this attribute is specified, it overrides the [`enctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#enctype) attribute of the button's form owner.

[`formmethod`](#formmethod)

If the button is a submit button (it's inside/associated with a `` and doesn't have `type="button"`), this attribute specifies the [HTTP method](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) used to submit the form. Possible values:

* `post`: The data from the form are included in the body of the HTTP request when sent to the server. Use when the form contains information that shouldn't be public, like login credentials.
* `get`: The form data are appended to the form's `action` URL, with a `?` as a separator, and the resulting URL is sent to the server. Use this method when the form [has no side effects](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent), like search forms.
* `dialog`: This method is used to indicate that the button closes the [dialog](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) with which it is associated, and does not transmit the form data at all.

If specified, this attribute overrides the [`method`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#method) attribute of the button's form owner.

[`formnovalidate`](#formnovalidate)

If the button is a submit button, this Boolean attribute specifies that the form is not to be [validated](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) when it is submitted. If this attribute is specified, it overrides the [`novalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#novalidate) attribute of the button's form owner.

This attribute is also available on [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) elements.

[`formtarget`](#formtarget)

If the button is a submit button, this attribute is an author\-defined name or standardized, underscore\-prefixed keyword indicating where to display the response from submitting the form. This is the `name` of, or keyword for, a *browsing context* (a tab, window, or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)). If this attribute is specified, it overrides the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#target) attribute of the button's form owner. The following keywords have special meanings:

* `_self`: Load the response into the same browsing context as the current one. This is the default if the attribute is not specified.
* `_blank`: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context — usually a new tab or window, depending on the user's browser settings.
* `_parent`: Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as `_self`.
* `_top`: Load the response into the top\-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as `_self`.

[`name`](#name)

The name of the button, submitted as a pair with the button's `value` as part of the form data, when that button is used to submit the form.

[`popovertarget`](#popovertarget)

Turns a `` element into a popover control button; takes the ID of the popover element to control as its value. See the [Popover API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API "Popover API") landing page for more details.

[`popovertargetaction`](#popovertargetaction)

Specifies the action to be performed on a popover element being controlled by a control ``. Possible values are:

[`"hide"`](#hide)

The button will hide a shown popover. If you try to hide an already hidden popover, no action will be taken.

[`"show"`](#show)

The button will show a hidden popover. If you try to show an already showing popover, no action will be taken.

[`"toggle"`](#toggle)

The button will toggle a popover between showing and hidden. If the popover is hidden, it will be shown; if the popover is showing, it will be hidden. If `popovertargetaction` is omitted, `"toggle"` is the default action that will be performed by the control button.

[`type`](#type)

The default behavior of the button. Possible values are:

* `submit`: The button submits the form data to the server. This is the default if the attribute is not specified for buttons associated with a ``, or if the attribute is an empty or invalid value.
* `reset`: The button resets all the controls to their initial values, like [\](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/reset). (This behavior tends to annoy users.)
* `button`: The button has no default behavior, and does nothing when pressed by default. It can have client\-side scripts listen to the element's events, which are triggered when the events occur.

[`value`](#value)

Defines the value associated with the button's `name` when it's submitted with the form data. This value is passed to the server in params when the form is submitted using this button.

## [Notes](#notes)

A submit button with the attribute `formaction` set, but without an associated form does nothing. You have to set a form owner, either by wrapping it in a `` or set the attribute `form` to the id of the form.

`` elements are much easier to style than [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements. You can add inner HTML content (think ``, ``, or even ``), and use [`::after`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) and [`::before`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) pseudo\-elements for complex rendering.

If your buttons are not for submitting form data to a server, be sure to set their `type` attribute to `button`. Otherwise, they will try to submit form data and to load the (nonexistent) response, possibly destroying the current state of the document.

While `` has no default behavior, event handlers can be scripted to trigger behaviors. An activated button can perform programmable actions using [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting), such as removing an item from a list.

By default, user agents style buttons as `display: flow-root`, which establishes a new [block formatting context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context) and centers the button's children both horizontally and vertically as long as they do not overflow. If the button is defined as a flex or grid container, the children will behave as flex or grid items. A button set to `display: inline` will be styled as if the value were set to `display: inline-block`.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Icon buttons](#icon_buttons)

Buttons that only display an icon do not have an *[accessible name](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_name)*. Accessible names provide information for assistive technology, such as screen readers, to access when they parse the document and generate [an accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility#accessibility_apis). Assistive technology then uses the accessibility tree to navigate and manipulate page content.

To give an icon button an accessible name, put text in the `` element that concisely describes the button's functionality.

#### Examples

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \\
 \
 Add to favorites
\

\`\`\`
##### Result

If you want to visually hide the button's text, an accessible way to do so is to use [a combination of CSS properties](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/) to remove it visually from the screen, but keep it parsable by assistive technology.

However, it is worth noting that leaving the button text visible can help people who may not be familiar with the icon's meaning or understand the button's purpose. This is especially important for people who are not technologically sophisticated or who may have different cultural interpretations of the icon the button uses.

### [Size and Proximity](#size_and_proximity)

#### Size

Interactive elements such as buttons should have an area large enough to be easy to activate. This helps a variety of people, including people with motor control issues and people using non\-precise forms of input such as a stylus or fingers. A minimum interactive size of 44×44 [CSS pixels](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_pixel) is recommended.

* [Quick test: Large touch targets \- The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/large-touch-targets/)

#### Proximity

Large amounts of interactive content — including buttons — placed in close visual proximity to each other should have space separating them. This spacing is beneficial for people who are experiencing motor control issues, who may accidentally activate the wrong interactive content.

Spacing may be created using CSS properties such as [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin).

* [Hand tremors and the giant\-button\-problem \- Axess Lab](https://axesslab.com/hand-tremors/)
### [ARIA state information](#aria_state_information)

To describe the state of a button the correct ARIA attribute to use is [`aria-pressed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-pressed) and not [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-checked) or [`aria-selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-selected). To find out more read the information about the [ARIA button role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role).

### [Button styles](#button_styles)

It is best not to override the default focus ring for elements that have focus. If the button styles are overridden, it is important to **ensure that the focus state has enough contrast** so that people experiencing low vision conditions can perceive it and people with cognitive differences will understand it.

The [`:focus-visible`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible) pseudo\-class can be used to apply styles to an element that has [`:focus`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) only when the user agent's heuristics determine that the focus should be highlighted, such as when a `` receives keyboard focus. See [:focus vs :focus\-visible](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible#focus_vs_focus-visible) for more information.

Color contrast ratio is determined by comparing the luminosity of the button text and background color values to the background the button is placed on. To meet current [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), a ratio of 4\.5:1 is required for text content and 3:1 for large text. (Large text is defined as 18\.66px and [`bold`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) or larger, or 24px or larger.)

* [Understanding Success Criterion 1\.4\.3 \| W3C Understanding WCAG 2\.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)
### [Clicking and focus](#clicking_and_focus)

Whether clicking on a `` or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) button types causes it to (by default) become focused varies by browser and OS. Most browsers do give focus to a button being clicked, but [Safari does not, by design](https://webkit.org/b/22261#c68).

## <canvas>: The Graphics Canvas element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas)

Use the **HTML `` element** with either the [canvas scripting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) or the [WebGL API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) to draw graphics and animations.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`height`](#height)

The height of the coordinate space in CSS pixels. Defaults to 150\.

[`moz-opaque` 
Non\-standard

Deprecated](#moz-opaque)

Lets the canvas know whether translucency will be a factor. If the canvas knows there's no translucency, painting performance can be optimized. This is only supported by Mozilla\-based browsers; use the standardized [`canvas.getContext('2d', { alpha: false })`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext "canvas.getContext('2d', { alpha: false })") instead.

[`width`](#width)

The width of the coordinate space in CSS pixels. Defaults to 300\.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

### [Alternative content](#alternative_content)

You should provide alternate content inside the `` block. That content will be rendered both on older browsers that don't support canvas and in browsers with JavaScript disabled.

### [Closing `` tag](#closing_canvas_tag)

Unlike the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element, the `` element **requires** the closing tag (``).

### [Sizing the canvas using CSS versus HTML](#sizing_the_canvas_using_css_versus_html)

The displayed size of the canvas can be changed using CSS, but if you do this the image is scaled during rendering to fit the styled size, which can make the final graphics rendering end up being distorted.

It is better to specify your canvas dimensions by setting the `width` and `height` attributes directly on the `` elements, either directly in the HTML or by using JavaScript.

### [Maximum canvas size](#maximum_canvas_size)

The exact maximum size of a `` element depends on the browser and environment. While in most cases the maximum dimensions exceed 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, notably iOS devices limit the canvas size to only 4,096 x 4,096 pixels. See [canvas size limits in different browsers and devices](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/canvas-size/#/?id=test-results).

**Note:**
Exceeding the maximum dimensions or area renders the canvas unusable — drawing commands will not work.

### [Using an offscreen canvas](#using_an_offscreen_canvas)

A canvas can be rendered using the [`OffscreenCanvas`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) API where the document and canvas are decoupled.
The benefit is that a [worker thread](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) can handle canvas rendering and the main thread of your web application is not blocked by canvas operations.
By parallelizing work, other UI elements of your web application will remain responsive even if you are running complex graphics on an offscreen canvas.
For more information, see the [`OffscreenCanvas`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas) API documentation.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Alternative content](#alternative_content_2)

The `` element on its own is just a bitmap and does not provide information about any drawn objects. Canvas content is not exposed to accessibility tools as semantic HTML is. In general, you should avoid using canvas in an accessible website or app. The following guides can help to make it more accessible.

* [Canvas accessibility use cases](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Canvas_Accessibility_Use_Cases)
* [Canvas element accessibility issues](https://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/AddedElementCanvas)
* [HTML Canvas Accessibility in Firefox 13 – by Steve Faulkner](https://www.tpgi.com/html5-canvas-accessibility-in-firefox-13/)
* [Best practices for interactive canvas elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#best-practices)
## [Examples](#examples)

### [HTML](#html)

This code snippet adds a canvas element to your HTML document. A fallback text is provided if a browser is unable to read or render the canvas.

html\`\`\`
\
 An alternative text describing what your canvas displays.
\

\`\`\`### [JavaScript](#javascript)

Then in the JavaScript code, call [`HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext) to get a drawing context and start drawing onto the canvas:

js\`\`\`
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.fillStyle = "green";
// Add a rectangle at (10, 10\) with size 100x100 pixels
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100\);

## <caption>: The Table Caption element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies the caption (or title) of a table, providing the table an [accessible description](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_description).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies on which side of the table the caption should be displayed. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `top`, `right`, or `bottom`. Use the [`caption-side`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caption-side) and [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS properties instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* If included, the `` element must be the first child of its parent [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element.
* When a `` is nested within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure) as the figure's only content, it should be captioned via a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption) for the `` instead of as a `` nested within the ``.
* Any [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) applied to a table will not be applied to its caption. Add a `background-color` to the `` element as well if you want the same color to be behind both.
## [Example](#example)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

### [Table with caption](#table_with_caption)

This example demonstrates a basic table that includes a caption describing the data presented.

Such a "title" is helpful for users who are quickly scanning the page, and it is especially beneficial for visually impaired users, allowing them to determine the table's relevance quickly without the need to have a screen reader read the contents of many cells just to find out what the table is about.

#### HTML

A `` element is used as the first child of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table), with text content similar to a title to describe the table data. Three rows, the first being a header row, with two columns are created using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements after the ``.

## <center>: The Centered Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a [block\-level element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) that displays its block\-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element. The container is usually, but isn't required to be, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body).

This tag has been deprecated in HTML 4 (and XHTML 1\) in favor of the [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) property, which can be applied to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) element or to an individual [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p). For centering blocks, use other CSS properties like [`margin-left`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-left) and [`margin-right`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-right) and set them to `auto` (or set [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) to `0 auto`).

## [DOM interface](#dom_interface)

This element implements the [`HTMLElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) interface.

## [Example 1](#example_1)

## <cite>: The Citation element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to mark up the title of a cited creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context\-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

In the context of the `` element, a creative work that might be cited could be, for example, one of the following:

* A book
* A research paper
* An essay
* A poem
* A musical score
* A song
* A play or film script
* A film
* A television show
* A game
* A sculpture
* A painting
* A theatrical production

* A computer program
* A website
* A web page
* A blog post or comment
* A forum post or comment
* A tweet
* A Facebook post
* A written or oral statement
* And so forth.

To include a reference to the source of quoted material which is contained within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q) element, use the [`cite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote#cite) attribute on the element.

Typically, browsers style the contents of a `` element in italics by default. To avoid this, apply the CSS [`font-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style) property to the `` element.

## <col>: The Table Column element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines one or more columns in a column group represented by its parent [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) element. The `` element is only valid as a child of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) element that has no [`span`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup#span) attribute defined.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`span`](#span)

Specifies the number of consecutive columns the `` element spans. The value must be a positive integer greater than zero. If not present, its default value is `1`.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of each column cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and on offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Note that this attribute overrides the specified [`align`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup#align) of its [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) parent element. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

**Note:**
Setting `text-align` on the `` element has no effect as `` has no descendants, and therefore no elements inherit from it.

If the table does not use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, use the `td:nth-of-type(an+b)` CSS selector. Set `a` to zero and `b` to the position of the column in the table, e.g. `td:nth-of-type(2) { text-align: right; }` to right\-align the second column cells.

If the table does use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like `[colspan=n]`, though this is not trivial.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of each column cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of each column cell. Typical values for this include a period (`.`) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored, though it will still override the specified [`char`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup#char) of its [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) parent element.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the column cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of each column cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Note that this attribute overrides the specified [`valign`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup#valign) of its [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) parent element. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

**Note:**
Setting `vertical-align` on the `` element has no effect as `` has no descendants, and therefore no elements inherit from it.

If the table does not use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, use the `td:nth-of-type(an+b)` CSS selector. Set `a` to zero and `b` to the position of the column in the table, e.g. `td:nth-of-type(2) { vertical-align: middle; }` to center the second column cells vertically.

If the table does use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like `[colspan=n]`, though this is not trivial.

[`width` 
Deprecated](#width)

Specifies a default width for each column. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute can take the special form `0*`, which means that the width of each column spanned should be the minimum width necessary to hold the column's contents. Relative widths such as `5*` can also be used. Note that this attribute overrides the specified [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup#width) of its [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) parent element. Use the [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` element is used within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) element that doesn't have a `span` attribute.
* The `` elements do not structurally group columns together. This is the role of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) element.
* Only a limited number of CSS properties affect ``:
	+ [`background`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) : The various `background` properties will set the background for cells within the column. As the column background color is painted on top of the table and column groups ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup)), but behind background colors applied to the row groups ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot)), the rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)), and the individual cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)), backgrounds applied to table columns are only visible if every layer painted on top of them has a transparent background.
	+ [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border): The various `border` properties apply, but only if the `` has [`border-collapse: collapse`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-collapse) set.
	+ [`visibility`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility): The value `collapse` for a column results in all cells of that column not being rendered, and cells spanning into other columns being clipped. The space these columns would have occupied is removed. However, the size of other columns is still calculated as though the cells in the collapsed column(s) are present. Other values for `visibility` have no effect.
	+ [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width): The `width` property defines a minimum width for the column, as if [`min-width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-width) were set.
## [Example](#example)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

This example demonstrates an eight\-column table divided into three `` elements.

### [HTML](#html)

A [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) element provides structures to a basic table, creating a single implicit column group. Three `` elements are included within the ``, creating three stylable columns. The [`span`](#span) attribute specifies the number of table columns each `` should span (defaulting to `1` when omitted), enabling attributes to be shared across the columns in each ``.

## <colgroup>: The Table Column Group element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a group of columns within a table.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`span`](#span)

Specifies the number of consecutive columns the `` element spans. The value must be a positive integer greater than zero. If not present, its default value is `1`.

**Note:**
The `span` attribute is not permitted if there are one or more [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col) elements within the ``.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of each column group cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and the offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Note that the descendant [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col) elements may override this value using their own [`align`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col#align) attribute. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

**Note:**
Setting `text-align` on the `` element has no effect as [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements are not descendants of the `` element, and therefore they do not inherit from it.

If the table does not use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, use the `td:nth-of-type(an+b)` CSS selector per column, where `a` is the total number of the columns in the table and `b` is the ordinal position of the column in the table, e.g. `td:nth-of-type(7n+2) { text-align: right; }` to right\-align the second column cells.

If the table does use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like `[colspan=n]`, though this is not trivial.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of each column group cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of each column group cell. Typical values for this include a period (`.`) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored, though it will still be used as the default value for the [`align`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col#align) of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col) elements which are members of this column group.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the column group cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of each column group cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Note that the descendant [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col) elements may override this value using their own [`valign`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col#valign) attribute. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

**Note:**
Setting `vertical-align` on the `` element has no effect as [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements are not descendants of the `` element, and therefore they do not inherit from it.

If the table does not use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, use the [`td:nth-of-type()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) CSS selector per column, e.g. `td:nth-of-type(2) { vertical-align: middle; }` to center the second column cells vertically.

If the table does use a [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like `[colspan=n]`, though this is not trivial.

[`width` 
Deprecated](#width)

Specifies a default width for each column in the current column group. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute can take the special form `0*`, which means that the width of each column spanned should be the minimum width necessary to hold the column's contents. Relative widths such as `5*` can also be used. Note that the descendant [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col) elements may override this value using their own [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col#width) attribute. Use the [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` should appear within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table), after any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) element (if used), but before any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements.
* Only a limited number of CSS properties affect ``:
	+ [`background`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) : The various `background` properties will set the background for cells within the column group. As the column group background color is painted on top of the table, but behind background colors applied to the columns ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col)), the row groups ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot)), the rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)), and the individual cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)), backgrounds applied to table column groups are only visible if every layer painted on top of them has a transparent background.
	+ [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border): The various `border` properties apply, but only if the `` has [`border-collapse: collapse`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-collapse) set.
	+ [`visibility`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility): The value `collapse` for a column group results in all cells of the columns in that column group not being rendered, and cells spanning into other columns being clipped. The space these columns in the column group would have occupied is removed. However, the size of other columns is still calculated as though the cells in the collapsed column(s) in the column group are present. Other values for `visibility` have no effect.
	+ [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width): The `width` property defines a minimum width for the columns within the column group, as if [`min-width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-width) were set.
## [Example](#example)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

This example demonstrates a seven\-column table divided into two `` elements that span multiple columns.

### [HTML](#html)

Two `` elements are used to structure a basic table by creating column groups. The number of columns in each column group is specified by the [`span`](#span) attribute.

## <datalist>: The HTML Data List element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element contains a set of [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) elements that represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls.

## [Try it](#try_it)

To bind the `` element to the control, we give it a unique identifier in the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute, and then add the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#list) attribute to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element with the same identifier as value.
Only certain types of [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) support this behavior, and it can also vary from browser to browser.

Each `` element should have a `value` attribute, which represents a suggestion to be entered into the input. It can also have a `label` attribute, or, missing that, some text content, which may be displayed by the browser instead of `value` (Firefox), or in addition to `value` (Chrome and Safari, as supplemental text). The exact content of the drop\-down menu depends on the browser, but when clicked, content entered into control field will always come from the `value` attribute.

**Note:** `` is not a replacement for [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select). A `` does not represent an input itself; it is a list of suggested values for an associated control. The control can still accept any value that passes validation, even if it is not in this suggestion list.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element has no other attributes than the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes), common to all elements.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

When deciding to use the `` element, here are some accessibility issues to be mindful of:

* The font size of the data list's options does not zoom, always remaining the same size. The contents of the autosuggest do not grow or shrink when the rest of the contents are zoomed in or out.
* As targeting the list of options with CSS is very limited to non\-existent, rendering can not be styled for high\-contrast mode.
* Some screen reader/browser combinations, including NVDA and Firefox, do not announce the contents of the autosuggest popup.
## [Examples](#examples)

### [Textual types](#textual_types)

Recommended values in types [text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text), [search](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search), [url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url), [tel](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel), [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email) and [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number), are displayed in a drop\-down menu when user clicks or double\-clicks on the control.
Typically the right side of a control will also have an arrow pointing to the presence of predefined values.

### [Date and Time types](#date_and_time_types)

The types [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month), [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week), [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date), [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time) and [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) can show an interface that allows a convenient selection of a date and time.
Predefined values can be shown there, allowing the user to quickly fill the control value.

**Note:**
When these types are not supported, a basic `text` type will be rendered instead, creating a text field. That field will correctly recognize recommended values and display them to the user in a drop\-down menu.

## <del>: The Deleted Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins) element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.

## [Try it](#try_it)

This element is often (but need not be) rendered by applying a strike\-through style to the text.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`cite`](#cite)

A URI for a resource that explains the change (for example, meeting minutes).

[`datetime`](#datetime)

This attribute indicates the time and date of the change and must be a valid date string with an optional time. If the value cannot be parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not have an associated timestamp. For the format of the string without a time, see [Date strings](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#date_strings). The format of the string if it includes both date and time is covered in [Local date and time strings](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#local_date_and_time_strings).

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The presence of the `del` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property, along with the [`::before`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and [`::after`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo\-elements.

css\`\`\`
del::before,
del::after {
 clip\-path: inset(100%);
 clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
 height: 1px;
 overflow: hidden;
 position: absolute;
 white\-space: nowrap;
 width: 1px;
}

del::before {
 content: " \[deletion start] ";
}

del::after {
 content: " \[deletion end] ";
}

\`\`\`
Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not knowing content has been deleted would adversely affect understanding.

## <details>: The Details disclosure element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) element.

A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle that rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. The contents of the `` element are used as the label for the disclosure widget. The contents of the `` provide the [accessible description](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_description) for the ``.

## [Try it](#try_it)

A `` widget can be in one of two states. The default *closed* state displays only the triangle and the label inside `` (or a [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent)\-defined default string if no ``).

When the user clicks on the widget or focuses it then presses the space bar, it "twists" open, revealing its contents. The common use of a triangle which rotates or twists around to represent opening or closing the widget is why these are sometimes called "twisty".

You can use CSS to style the disclosure widget, and you can programmatically open and close the widget by setting/removing its [`open`](#open) attribute. Unfortunately, at this time, there's no built\-in way to animate the transition between open and closed.

By default when closed, the widget is only tall enough to display the disclosure triangle and summary. When open, it expands to display the details contained within.

Fully standards\-compliant implementations automatically apply the CSS `[display](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display): list-item` to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) element. You can use this or the [`::marker`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) pseudo\-element to [customize the disclosure widget](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary#changing_the_summarys_icon).

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`open`](#open)

This Boolean attribute indicates whether the details — that is, the contents of the `` element — are currently visible. The details are shown when this attribute exists, or hidden when this attribute is absent. By default this attribute is absent which means the details are not visible.

**Note:**
You have to remove this attribute entirely to make the details hidden. `open="false"` makes the details visible because this attribute is Boolean.

[`name`](#name)

This attribute enables multiple `` elements to be connected, with only one open at a time. This allows developers to easily create UI features such as accordions without scripting.

The `name` attribute specifies a group name — give multiple `` elements the same `name` value to group them. Only one of the grouped `` elements can be open at a time — opening one will cause another to close. If multiple grouped `` elements are given the `open` attribute, only the first one in the source order will be rendered open.

**Note:** `` elements don't have to be adjacent to one another in the source to be part of the same group.

## [Events](#events)

In addition to the usual events supported by HTML elements, the `` element supports the [`toggle`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/toggle_event "toggle") event, which is dispatched to the `` element whenever its state changes between open and closed. It is sent *after* the state is changed, although if the state changes multiple times before the browser can dispatch the event, the events are coalesced so that only one is sent.

You can use an event listener for the `toggle` event to detect when the widget changes state:

js\`\`\`
details.addEventListener("toggle", (event) =\> {
 if (details.open) {
 /\* the element was toggled open \*/
 } else {
 /\* the element was toggled closed \*/
 }
});

\`\`\`## [Examples](#examples)

### [Customizing the appearance](#customizing_the_appearance)

Now let's apply some CSS to customize the appearance of the disclosure box.

#### CSS

css\`\`\`
details {
 font:
 16px "Open Sans",
 Calibri,

 width: 620px;
}

details \> summary {
 padding: 2px 6px;
 width: 15em;
 background\-color: \#ddd;
 border: none;
 box\-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
 cursor: pointer;
}

details \> p {
 border\-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
 background\-color: \#ddd;
 padding: 2px 6px;
 margin: 0;
 box\-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
}

details\[open] \> summary {
 background\-color: \#ccf;
}

\`\`\`
This CSS creates a look similar to a tabbed interface, where clicking the tab opens it to reveal its contents.

The selector `details[open]` can be used to style the element which is open.

## <dfn>: The Definition element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dfn)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates a term to be defined. The `` element should be used in a complete definition statement, where the full definition of the term can be one of the following:

* The ancestor paragraph (a block of text, sometimes marked by a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) element)
* The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt)/[``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd) pairing
* The nearest [section](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories#sectioning_content) ancestor of the `` element,
## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

The [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) attribute has special meaning, as noted below.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

There are some not\-entirely\-obvious aspects to using the `` element. We examine those here.

### [Specifying the term being defined](#specifying_the_term_being_defined)

The term being defined is identified following these rules:

1. If the `` element has a [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) attribute, the value of the `title` attribute is considered to be the term being defined. The element must still have text within it, but that text may be an abbreviation (perhaps using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr)) or another form of the term.
2. If the `` contains a single child element and does not have any text content of its own, and the child element is an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr) element with a `title` attribute itself, then the exact value of the `` element's `title` is the term being defined.
3. Otherwise, the text content of the `` element is the term being defined. This is shown [in the first example below](#basic_identification_of_a_term).

**Note:**
If the `` element has a `title` attribute, it *must* contain the term being defined and no other text.

### [Links to `` elements](#links_to_dfn_elements)

If you include an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute on the `` element, you can then link to it using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) elements. Such links should be uses of the term, with the intent being that the reader can quickly navigate to the term's definition if they're not already aware of it, by clicking on the term's link.

This is shown in the example under [Links to definitions](#links_to_definitions) below.

## [Examples](#examples)

Let's take a look at some examples of various usage scenarios.

### [Basic identification of a term](#basic_identification_of_a_term)

This example uses a plain `` element to identify the location of a term within the definition.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 The \HTML Definition element (\\<dfn\>\)\ is used
 to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase
 or sentence.
\

\`\`\`
Since the `` element has no `title`, the text contents of the `` element itself are used as the term being defined.

#### Result

### [Links to definitions](#links_to_definitions)

To add links to the definitions, you create the link the same way you always do, with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) element.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 The
 \HTML Definition element (\\<dfn\>\)\
 is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition
 phrase or sentence.
\

\
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Graece donan, Latine
 voluptatem vocant. Confecta res esset. Duo Reges: constructio interrete.
 Scrupulum, inquam, abeunti;
\

\
 Because of all of that, we decided to use the
 \\\<dfn\>\\ element for this
 project.
\

\`\`\`
Here we see the definition — now with an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute, `"definition-dfn"`, which can be used as the target of a link. Later on, a link is created using `` with the [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#href) attribute set to `"#definition-dfn"` to set up the link back to the definition.

#### Result

### [Using abbreviations and definitions together](#using_abbreviations_and_definitions_together)

In some cases, you may wish to use an abbreviation for a term when defining it. This can be done by using the `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr) elements in tandem, like this:

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 The \\HST\\ is among the
 most productive scientific instruments ever constructed. It has been in orbit
 for over 20 years, scanning the sky and returning data and photographs of
 unprecedented quality and detail.
\

\
 Indeed, the \HST\ has arguably done
 more to advance science than any device ever built.
\

\`\`\`
Note the `` element nested inside the ``. The former establishes that the term is an abbreviation ("HST") and specifies the full term ("Hubble Space Telescope") in its `title` attribute. The latter indicates that the abbreviated term represents a term being defined.

## <dialog>: The Dialog element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a modal or non\-modal dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.

The HTML `` element is used to create both modal and non\-modal dialog boxes. Modal dialog boxes interrupt interaction with the rest of the page being inert, while non\-modal dialog boxes allow interaction with the rest of the page.

JavaScript should be used to display the `` element. Use the [`.showModal()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal ".showModal()") method to display a modal dialog and the [`.show()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/show ".show()") method to display a non\-modal dialog. The dialog box can be closed using the [`.close()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/close ".close()") method or using the [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#method) method when submitting a `` that is nested within the `` element. Modal dialogs can also be closed by pressing the `Esc` key.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

**Warning:**
The `tabindex` attribute must not be used on the `` element. See [usage notes](#usage_notes).

[`open`](#open)

Indicates that the dialog box is active and is available for interaction. If the `open` attribute is not set, the dialog box will not be visible to the user.
It is recommended to use the `.show()` or `.showModal()` method to render dialogs, rather than the `open` attribute. If a `` is opened using the `open` attribute, it is non\-modal.

**Note:**
While you can toggle between the open and closed states of non\-modal dialog boxes by toggling the presence of the `open` attribute, this approach is not recommended.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* HTML [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) elements can be used to close a dialog box if they have the attribute `method="dialog"` or if the button used to submit the form has [`formmethod="dialog"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#formmethod) set. When a `` within a `` is submitted via the `dialog` method, the dialog box closes, the states of the form controls are saved but not submitted, and the [`returnValue`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/returnValue "returnValue") property gets set to the value of the button that was activated.
* The CSS [`::backdrop`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) pseudo\-element can be used to style the backdrop of a modal dialog, which is displayed behind the `` element when the dialog is displayed using the [`HTMLDialogElement.showModal()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal) method. For example, this pseudo\-element could be used to blur, darken, or otherwise obfuscate the inert content behind the modal dialog.
* The [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute should be added to the element the user is expected to interact with immediately upon opening a modal dialog. If no other element involves more immediate interaction, it is recommended to add `autofocus` to the close button inside the dialog, or the dialog itself if the user is expected to click/activate it to dismiss.
* Do not add the `tabindex` property to the `` element as it is not interactive and does not receive focus. The dialog's contents, including the close button contained in the dialog, can receive focus and be interactive.
## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

When implementing a dialog, it is important to consider the most appropriate place to set user focus. When using [`HTMLDialogElement.showModal()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal) to open a ``, focus is set on the first nested focusable element. Explicitly indicating the initial focus placement by using the [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute will help ensure initial focus is set on the element deemed the best initial focus placement for any particular dialog. When in doubt, as it may not always be known where initial focus could be set within a dialog, particularly for instances where a dialog's content is dynamically rendered when invoked, the `` element itself may provide the best initial focus placement.

Ensure a mechanism is provided to allow users to close the dialog. The most robust way to ensure that all users can close the dialog is to include an explicit button to do so, such as a confirmation, cancellation, or close button.

By default, a dialog invoked by the `showModal()` method can be dismissed by pressing the `Esc` key. A non\-modal dialog does not dismiss via the `Esc` key by default, and depending on what the non\-modal dialog represents, it may not be desired for this behavior. Keyboard users expect the `Esc` key to close modal dialogs; ensure that this behavior is implemented and maintained. If multiple modal dialogs are open, pressing the `Esc` key should close only the last shown dialog. When using ``, this behavior is provided by the browser.

While dialogs can be created using other elements, the native `` element provides usability and accessibility features that must be replicated if you use other elements for a similar purpose. If you're creating a custom dialog implementation, ensure that all expected default behaviors are supported and proper labeling recommendations are followed.

The `` element is exposed by browsers in a manner similar to custom dialogs that use the ARIA [role="dialog"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role) attribute. `` elements invoked by the `showModal()` method implicitly have [aria\-modal="true"](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-modal), whereas `` elements invoked by the `show()` method or displayed using the `open` attribute or by changing the default `display` of a `` are exposed as `[aria-modal="false"]`. When implementing modal dialogs, everything other than the `` and its contents should be rendered inert using the [`inert`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) attribute. When using `` along with the `HTMLDialogElement.showModal()` method, this behavior is provided by the browser.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [HTML\-only dialog](#html-only_dialog)

This example demonstrates the creation of a non\-modal dialog by using only HTML. Because of the boolean `open` attribute in the `` element, the dialog appears open when the page loads. The dialog can be closed by clicking the "OK" button because the `method` attribute in the `` element is set to `"dialog"`. In this case, no JavaScript is needed to close the form.

html\`\`\`
\
 \Greetings, one and all!\
 \
 \OK\
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

**Note:**
Reload the page to reset the output.

This dialog is initially open because of the presence of the `open` attribute. Dialogs that are displayed using the `open` attribute are non\-modal. After clicking "OK", the dialog gets dismissed, leaving the Result frame empty. When the dialog is dismissed, there is no method provided to reopen it. For this reason, the preferred method to display non\-modal dialogs is by using the [`HTMLDialogElement.show()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/show) method. It is possible to toggle the display of the dialog by adding or removing the boolean `open` attribute, but it is not the recommended practice.

### [Creating a modal dialog](#creating_a_modal_dialog)

This example demonstrates a modal dialog with a [gradient](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient) backdrop. The `.showModal()` method opens the modal dialog when the "Show the dialog" button is activated. The dialog can be closed by pressing the `Esc` key or via the `close()` method when the "Close" button within the dialog is activated.

When a dialog opens, the browser, by default, gives focus to the first element that can be focused within the dialog. In this example, the [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute is applied to the "Close" button, giving it focus when the dialog opens, as this is the element we expect the user will interact with immediately after the dialog opens.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 \Close\
 \This modal dialog has a groovy backdrop!\
\
\Show the dialog\

\`\`\`
#### CSS

We can style the backdrop of the dialog by using the [`::backdrop`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) pseudo\-element.

css\`\`\`
::backdrop {
 background\-image: linear\-gradient(
 45deg,
 magenta,
 rebeccapurple,
 dodgerblue,
 green
 );
 opacity: 0\.75;
}

\`\`\`
#### JavaScript

The dialog is opened modally using the `.showModal()` method and closed using the `.close()` method.

js\`\`\`
const dialog = document.querySelector("dialog");
const showButton = document.querySelector("dialog \+ button");
const closeButton = document.querySelector("dialog button");

// "Show the dialog" button opens the dialog modally
showButton.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 dialog.showModal();
});

// "Close" button closes the dialog
closeButton.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 dialog.close();
});

\`\`\`
#### Result

When the modal dialog is displayed, it appears above any other dialogs that might be present. Everything outside the modal dialog is inert and interactions outside the dialog are blocked. Notice that when the dialog is open, with the exception of the dialog itself, interaction with the document is not possible; the "Show the dialog" button is mostly obfuscated by the almost opaque backdrop of the dialog and is inert.

### [Handling the return value from the dialog](#handling_the_return_value_from_the_dialog)

This example demonstrates the [`returnValue`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/returnValue) of the `` element and how to close a modal dialog by using a form. By default, the `returnValue` is the empty string or the value of the button that submits the form within the `` element, if there is one.

This example opens a modal dialog when the "Show the dialog" button is activated. The dialog contains a form with a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) and two [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) elements, which default to `type="submit"`. An event listener updates the value of the "Confirm" button when the select option changes. If the "Confirm" button is activated to close the dialog, the current value of the button is the return value. If the dialog is closed by pressing the "Cancel" button, the `returnValue` is `cancel`.

When the dialog is closed, the return value is displayed under the "Show the dialog" button. If the dialog is closed by pressing the `Esc` key, the `returnValue` is not updated, and the `close` event doesn't occur, so the text in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output) is not updated.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
\
 \
 \
 \

 \
 \Choose…\

 \Spider monkey\
 \
 \

\`\`\`
#### JavaScript

js\`\`\`
const showButton = document.getElementById("showDialog");
const favDialog = document.getElementById("favDialog");
const outputBox = document.querySelector("output");
const selectEl = favDialog.querySelector("select");
const confirmBtn = favDialog.querySelector("\#confirmBtn");

// "Show the dialog" button opens the \ modally
showButton.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 favDialog.showModal();
});

// "Cancel" button closes the dialog without submitting because of \[formmethod="dialog"], triggering a close event.
favDialog.addEventListener("close", (e) =\> {
 outputBox.value =
 favDialog.returnValue === "default"
 ? "No return value."
 : \`ReturnValue: ${favDialog.returnValue}.\`; // Have to check for "default" rather than empty string
});

// Prevent the "confirm" button from the default behavior of submitting the form, and close the dialog with the \`close()\` method, which triggers the "close" event.
confirmBtn.addEventListener("click", (event) =\> {
 event.preventDefault(); // We don't want to submit this fake form
 favDialog.close(selectEl.value); // Have to send the select box value here.
});

\`\`\`
#### Result

The above examples demonstrate the following three methods of closing modal dialogs:

* By submitting the form within the dialog form using the `dialog` method (as seen in the [HTML\-only example](#html-only_dialog)).
* By pressing the `Esc` key.
* By calling the [`HTMLDialogElement.close()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/close) method (as seen in the [modal example](#creating_a_modal_dialog)).
In this example, the "Cancel" button closes the dialog via the `dialog` form method and the "Confirm" button closes the dialog via the [`HTMLDialogElement.close()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/close) method.

The "Cancel" button includes the [`formmethod="dialog"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit#formmethod) attribute, which overrides the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)'s default [`GET`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) method. When a form's method is [`dialog`](#usage_notes), the state of the form is saved but not submitted, and the dialog gets closed.

Without an `action`, submitting the form via the default [`GET`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) method causes a page to reload. We use JavaScript to prevent the submission and close the dialog with the [`event.preventDefault()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) and [`HTMLDialogElement.close()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/close) methods, respectively.

It is important to provide a closing mechanism within every `dialog` element. The `Esc` key does not close non\-modal dialogs by default, nor can one assume that a user will even have access to a physical keyboard (e.g., someone using a touch screen device without access to a keyboard).

### [Closing a dialog with a required form input](#closing_a_dialog_with_a_required_form_input)

When a form inside a dialog has a required input, the user agent will only let you close the dialog once you provide a value for the required input. To close such dialog, either use the [`formnovalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#formnovalidate) attribute on the close button or call the `close()` method on the dialog object when the close button is clicked.

#### JavaScript

const showBtn = document.getElementById("show\-dialog");
const dialog = document.getElementById("dialog");
const jsCloseBtn = dialog.querySelector("\#js\-close");

showBtn.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 dialog.showModal();
});

jsCloseBtn.addEventListener("click", (e) =\> {
 e.preventDefault();
 dialog.close();
});

\`\`\`
#### Result

From the output, we see it is impossible to close the dialog using the *Normal close* button. But the dialog can be closed if we bypass the form validation using the `formnovalidate` attribute on the *Cancel* button. Programmatically, `dialog.close()` will also close such dialog.

### [Animating dialogs](#animating_dialogs)

``s are set to [`display: none;`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) when hidden and `display: block;` when shown, as well as being removed from / added to the [top layer](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer) and the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work#building_the_accessibility_tree). Therefore, for `` elements to be animated the [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property needs to be animatable. [Supporting browsers](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#browser_compatibility) animate `display` with a variation on the [discrete animation type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties#discrete). Specifically, the browser will flip between `none` and another value of `display` so that the animated content is shown for the entire animation duration.

So for example:

* When animating `display` from `none` to `block` (or another visible `display` value), the value will flip to `block` at `0%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.
* When animating `display` from `block` (or another visible `display` value) to `none`, the value will flip to `none` at `100%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.

**Note:**
When animating using [CSS transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions), [`transition-behavior: allow-discrete`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior) needs to be set to enable the above behavior. This behavior is available by default when animating with [CSS animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations); an equivalent step is not required.

#### Transitioning dialog elements

When animating ``s with CSS transitions, the following features are required:

[`@starting-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style) at\-rule

Provides a set of starting values for properties set on the `` that you want to transition from every time it is opened. This is needed to avoid unexpected behavior. By default, CSS transitions only occur when a property changes from one value to another on a visible element; they are not triggered on elements' first style updates, or when the `display` type changes from `none` to another type.

[`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property

Add `display` to the transitions list so that the `` will remain as `display: block` (or another visible `display` value set on the dialog's open state) for the duration of the transition, ensuring the other transitions are visible.

[`overlay`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overlay) property

Include `overlay` in the transitions list to ensure the removal of the `` from the top layer is deferred until the transition completes, again ensuring the transition is visible.

[`transition-behavior`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior) property

Set `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` on the `display` and `overlay` transitions (or on the [`transition`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) shorthand) to enable discrete transitions on these two properties that are not by default animatable.

Here is a quick example to show what this might look like.

##### HTML

The HTML contains a `` element, plus a button to show the dialog. Additionally, the `` element contains another button to close itself.

html\`\`\`
\
 Content here
 \close\
\

\Show Modal\

\`\`\`
##### CSS

In the CSS, we include a `@starting-style` block that defines the transition starting styles for the `opacity` and `transform` properties, transition end styles on the `dialog[open]` state, and default styles on the default `dialog` state to transition back to once the `` has appeared. Note how the ``'s `transition` list includes not only these properties, but also the `display` and `overlay` properties, each with `allow-discrete` set on them.

We also set a starting style value for the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) property on the [`::backdrop`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) that appears behind the `` when it opens, to provide a nice darkening animation. The `dialog[open]::backdrop` selector selects only the backdrops of `` elements when the dialog is open.

css\`\`\`
/\* Open state of the dialog \*/
dialog\[open] {
 opacity: 1;
 transform: scaleY(1\);
}

/\* Closed state of the dialog \*/
dialog {
 opacity: 0;
 transform: scaleY(0\);
 transition:
 opacity 0\.7s ease\-out,
 transform 0\.7s ease\-out,
 overlay 0\.7s ease\-out allow\-discrete,
 display 0\.7s ease\-out allow\-discrete;
 /\* Equivalent to
 transition: all 0\.7s allow\-discrete; \*/
}

/\* Before\-open state \*/
/\* Needs to be after the previous dialog\[open] rule to take effect,
 as the specificity is the same \*/
@starting\-style {
 dialog\[open] {
 opacity: 0;
 transform: scaleY(0\);
 }
}

/\* Transition the :backdrop when the dialog modal is promoted to the top layer \*/
dialog::backdrop {
 background\-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
 transition:
 display 0\.7s allow\-discrete,
 overlay 0\.7s allow\-discrete,
 background\-color 0\.7s;
 /\* Equivalent to
 transition: all 0\.7s allow\-discrete; \*/
}

dialog\[open]::backdrop {
 background\-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 25%);
}

/\* This starting\-style rule cannot be nested inside the above selector
because the nesting selector cannot represent pseudo\-elements. \*/

@starting\-style {
 dialog\[open]::backdrop {
 background\-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
 }
}

\`\`\`
##### JavaScript

The JavaScript adds event handlers to the show and close buttons causing them to show and close the `` when they are clicked:

js\`\`\`
const dialogElem = document.getElementById("dialog");
const showBtn = document.querySelector(".show");
const closeBtn = document.querySelector(".close");

showBtn.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 dialogElem.showModal();
});

closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 dialogElem.close();
});

\`\`\`
##### Result

The code renders as follows:

**Note:**
Because ``s change from `display: none` to `display: block` each time they are shown, the `` transitions from its `@starting-style` styles to its `dialog[open]` styles every time the entry transition occurs. When the `` closes, it transitions from its `dialog[open]` state to the default `dialog` state.

It is possible for the style transition on entry and exit to be different in such cases. See our [Demonstration of when starting styles are used](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style#demonstration_of_when_starting_styles_are_used) example for a proof of this.

#### dialog keyframe animations

When animating a `` with CSS keyframe animations, there are some differences to note from transitions:

* You don't provide a `@starting-style`.
* You include the `display` value in a keyframe; this will be the `display` value for the entirety of the animation, or until another non\-`none` display value is encountered.
* You don't need to explicitly enable discrete animations; there is no equivalent to `allow-discrete` inside keyframes.
* You don't need to set `overlay` inside keyframes either; the `display` animation handles the animation of the `` from shown to hidden.

Let's have a look at an example so you can see what this looks like.

##### HTML

First, the HTML contains a `` element, plus a button to show the dialog. Additionally, the `` element contains another button to close itself.

html\`\`\`
\
 Content here
 \close\
\

\Show Modal\

\`\`\`
##### CSS

The CSS defines keyframes to animate between the closed and shown states of the ``, plus the fade\-in animation for the ``'s backdrop. The `` animations include animating `display` to make sure the actual visible animation effects remain visible for the whole duration. Note that it wasn't possible to animate the backdrop fade out — the backdrop is immediately removed from the DOM when the `` is closed, so there is nothing to animate.

css\`\`\`
dialog {
 animation: fade\-out 0\.7s ease\-out;
}

dialog\[open] {
 animation: fade\-in 0\.7s ease\-out;
}

dialog\[open]::backdrop {
 animation: backdrop\-fade\-in 0\.7s ease\-out forwards;
}

/\* Animation keyframes \*/

@keyframes fade\-in {
 0% {
 opacity: 0;
 transform: scaleY(0\);
 display: none;
 }

 100% {
 opacity: 1;
 transform: scaleY(1\);
 display: block;
 }
}

@keyframes fade\-out {
 0% {
 opacity: 1;
 transform: scaleY(1\);
 display: block;
 }

 100% {
 opacity: 0;
 transform: scaleY(0\);
 display: none;
 }
}

@keyframes backdrop\-fade\-in {
 0% {
 background\-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
 }

 100% {
 background\-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 25%);
 }
}

body,
button {
 font\-family: system\-ui;
}

\`\`\`
##### JavaScript

Finally, the JavaScript adds event handlers to the buttons to enable showing and closing the ``:

js\`\`\`
const dialogElem = document.getElementById("dialog");
const showBtn = document.querySelector(".show");
const closeBtn = document.querySelector(".close");

showBtn.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 dialogElem.showModal();
});

closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 dialogElem.close();
});

\`\`\`
##### Result

The code renders as follows:

## <dir>: The Directory element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dir)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used as a container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent). Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) element for lists, including lists of files.

**Warning:**
Do not use this element. Though present in early HTML specifications, it has been deprecated in HTML 4, and has since been removed entirely.

## [DOM interface](#dom_interface)

This element implements the `HTMLDirectoryElement` interface.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`compact` 
Deprecated](#compact)

This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the user agent and it doesn't work in all browsers.

## <div>: The Content Division element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like [Flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) is applied to its parent element).

## [Try it](#try_it)

As a "pure" container, the `` element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) or [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) attribute), and so on.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

**Note:**
The `align` attribute is obsolete; do not use it anymore. Instead, you should use CSS properties or techniques such as [CSS Grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) or [CSS Flexbox](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox) to align and position `` elements on the page.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` element should be used only when no other semantic element (such as [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)) is appropriate.
## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The `` element has [an implicit role of `generic`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#generic), and not none. This may affect certain ARIA combination declarations that expect a direct descendant element with a certain role to function properly.

## <dl>: The Description List element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt) element) and descriptions (provided by [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd) elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key\-value pairs).

## [Try it](#try_it)

Do not use this element (nor [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) elements) to merely create indentation on a page. Although it works, this is a bad practice and obscures the meaning of description lists.

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl) element. It is usually followed by a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd) element; however, multiple `` elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd) element.

## <em>: The Emphasis element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element marks text that has stress emphasis. The `` element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element is for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text, which is often limited to a word or words of a sentence and affects the meaning of the sentence itself.

Typically this element is displayed in italic type. However, it should not be used to apply italic styling; use the CSS [`font-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style) property for that purpose. Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite) element to mark the title of a work (book, play, song, etc.). Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i) element to mark text that is in an alternate tone or mood, which covers many common situations for italics such as scientific names or words in other languages. Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) element to mark text that has greater importance than surrounding text.

### [\ vs. \](#i_vs._em)

Some developers may be confused by how multiple elements seemingly produce similar visual results. `` and `` are a common example, since they both italicize text. What's the difference? Which should you use?

By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is different. The `` element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the `` element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such as a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning. (The title of a work, such as the name of a book or movie, should use ``.)

This means the right one to use depends on the situation. Neither is for purely decorative purposes, that's what CSS styling is for.

Examples for `` could be:

html\`\`\`
\Just \do\ it already!\
\We \had\ to do something about it.\

\`\`\`

A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

Examples for `` could be:

html\`\`\`
\The word \the\ is an article.\
\The \Queen Mary\ sailed last night.\

\`\`\`

Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary but a ship named "Queen Mary".

## [Examples](#examples)

In this example, the `` element is used to highlight an implicit or explicit contrast between two ingredient lists:

html\`\`\`
\
 Ice cream is made with milk, sweetener, and cream. Frozen custard, on the
 other hand, is made of milk, cream, sweetener, and \egg yolks\.
\

## <embed>: The Embed External Content element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug\-in.

## [Try it](#try_it)

**Note:**
This topic documents only the element that is defined as part of the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-embed-element). It does not address earlier, non\-standardized implementation of the element.

Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for browser plug\-ins, so relying upon `` is generally not wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user's browser.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`height`](#height)

The displayed height of the resource, in [CSS pixels](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#px). This must be an absolute value; percentages are *not* allowed.

[`src`](#src)

The URL of the resource being embedded.

[`type`](#type)

The [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type) to use to select the plug\-in to instantiate.

[`width`](#width)

The displayed width of the resource, in [CSS pixels](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#px). This must be an absolute value; percentages are *not* allowed.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

You can use the [`object-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property to adjust the positioning of the embedded object within the element's frame.

**Note:**
The [`object-fit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property has no effect on `` elements.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Use the [`title` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) on an `embed` element to label its content so that people navigating with assistive technology such as a screen reader can understand what it contains. The title's value should concisely describe the embedded content. Without a title, they may not be able to determine what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and time\-consuming, especially if the `embed` element contains interactive content like video or audio.

## <fencedframe>: The Fenced Frame element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fencedframe)

**Experimental:** **This is an [experimental technology](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a nested [browsing context](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context), embedding another HTML page into the current one. ``s are very similar to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) elements in form and function, except that:

* Communication is restricted between the `` content and its embedding site.
* A `` can access cross\-site data, but only in a very specific set of controlled circumstances that preserve user privacy.
* A `` cannot be manipulated or have its data accessed via regular scripting (for example reading or setting the source URL). `` content can only be embedded via [specific APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API#use_cases).
* A `` cannot access the embedding context's DOM, nor can the embedding context access the ``'s DOM.

The `` element is a type of `` with more native privacy features built in. It addresses shortcomings of ``s such as reliance on third\-party cookies and other privacy risks. See [Fenced frame API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API) for more details.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`allow` 
Experimental](#allow)

Specifies a [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy) for the ``, which defines what features are available to the `` based on the origin of the request. See [Permissions policies available to fenced frames](#permissions_policies_available_to_fenced_frames) for more details of which features can be controlled via a policy set on a fenced frame.

[`height` 
Experimental](#height)

A unitless integer representing the height of the fenced frame in CSS pixels. The default is `150`.

[`width` 
Experimental](#width)

A unitless integer representing the width of the fenced frame in CSS pixels. The default is `300`.

## [Permissions policies available to fenced frames](#permissions_policies_available_to_fenced_frames)

Permissions delegated from the top\-level context to a fenced frame for allowing and denying features could be used as a communication channel, so constitute a privacy threat. As a result, standard web features that can have their availability controlled via [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy) (for example, [`camera`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/camera) or [`geolocation`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/geolocation)) are **not available** within fenced frames.

The only features that can be enabled by a policy inside fenced frames are the specific features designed to be used inside fenced frames:

* [Protected Audience API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/private-advertising/protected-audience)
	+ `attribution-reporting`
	+ `private-aggregation`
	+ `shared-storage`
	+ `shared-storage-select-url`
* [Shared Storage API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Shared_Storage_API)
	+ `attribution-reporting`
	+ `private-aggregation`
	+ `shared-storage`
	+ `shared-storage-select-url`

Currently these are always enabled inside fenced frames. In the future, which ones are enabled will be controllable using the `` `allow` attribute. Blocking privacy sandbox features in this manner will also block the fenced frame from loading — there will be no communication channel at all.

## [Focusing across fenced frame boundaries](#focusing_across_fenced_frame_boundaries)

The ability of the document's active focus to be moved across fenced frame boundaries (i.e. from an element outside the fenced frame to one inside, or vice versa) is limited. User\-initiated actions such as a click or a tab can do so, as there is no fingerprinting risk there.

However, trying to traverse the boundary via an API call such as [`HTMLElement.focus()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) is prohibited — a malicious script could use a series of such calls to leak inferred information across the boundary.

## [Positioning and scaling](#positioning_and_scaling)

Being a [replaced element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element), the `` allows the position of the embedded document within its box to be adjusted using the [`object-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property.

**Note:**
The [`object-fit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property has no effect on `` elements.

The size of the embedded content may be set by internal `contentWidth` and `contentHeight` properties of the ``'s [`config`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFencedFrameElement/config "config") object. In such cases, changing the `width` or `height` of the `` will change the size of the embedded container on the page, but the document inside the container will be visually scaled to fit. The reported width and height of the embedded document (i.e. [`Window.innerWidth`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerWidth) and [`Window.innerHeight`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/innerHeight)) will be unchanged.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

People navigating with assistive technology such as a screen reader can use the [`title` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) on an `` to label its content. The title's value should concisely describe the embedded content:

html\`\`\`
\\

\`\`\`
Without this title, they have to navigate into the `` to determine what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and time\-consuming, especially for pages with multiple ``s and/or if embeds contain interactive content like video or audio.

## [Examples](#examples)

To set what content will be shown in a ``, a utilizing API (such as [Protected Audience](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/private-advertising/protected-audience) or [Shared Storage](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/private-advertising/shared-storage)) generates a [`FencedFrameConfig`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FencedFrameConfig) object, which is then set as the value of the ``'s `config` property.

The following example gets a `FencedFrameConfig` from a Protected Audience API's ad auction, which is then used to display the winning ad in a ``:

html\`\`\`
\\

\`\`\`
js\`\`\`
const frameConfig = await navigator.runAdAuction({
 // ...auction configuration
 resolveToConfig: true,
});

const frame = document.querySelector("fencedframe");
frame.config = frameConfig;

\`\`\`

**Note:** `resolveToConfig: true` must be passed in to the `runAdAuction()` call to obtain a `FencedFrameConfig` object. If it is not set, the resulting [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) will resolve to a URN that can only be used in an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

## <fieldset>: The Field Set element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to group several controls as well as labels ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)) within a web form.

## [Try it](#try_it)

As the example above shows, the `` element provides a grouping for a part of an HTML form, with a nested [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend) element providing a caption for the ``. It takes few attributes, the most notable of which are `form`, which can contain the `id` of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) on the same page, allowing you to make the `` part of that `` even if it is not nested inside it, and `disabled`, which allows you to disable the `` and all its contents in one go.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)

If this Boolean attribute is set, all form controls that are descendants of the ``, are disabled, meaning they are not editable and won't be submitted along with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form). They won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus\-related events. By default browsers display such controls grayed out. Note that form elements inside the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend) element won't be disabled.

[`form`](#form)

This attribute takes the value of the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element you want the `` to be part of, even if it is not inside the form. Please note that usage of this is confusing — if you want the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements inside the `` to be associated with the form, you need to use the `form` attribute directly on those elements. You can check which elements are associated with a form via JavaScript, using [`HTMLFormElement.elements`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/elements).

[`name`](#name)

The name associated with the group.

**Note:**
The caption for the fieldset is given by the first [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend) element nested inside it.

## [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

There are several special styling considerations for ``.

Its [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) value is `block` by default, and it establishes a [block formatting context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context). If the `` is styled with an inline\-level `display` value, it will behave as `inline-block`, otherwise it will behave as `block`. By default there is a `2px` `groove` border surrounding the contents, and a small amount of default padding. The element has [`min-inline-size: min-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-inline-size) by default.

If a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend) is present, it is placed over the `block-start` border. The `` shrink\-wraps, and also establishes a formatting context. The `display` value is blockified. (For example, `display: inline` behaves as `block`.)

There will be an anonymous box holding the contents of the ``, which inherits certain properties from the ``. If the `` is styled with `display: grid` or `display: inline-grid`, then the anonymous box will be a grid formatting context. If the `` is styled with `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex`, then the anonymous box will be a flex formatting context. Otherwise, it establishes a block formatting context.

You can feel free to style the `` and `` in any way you want to suit your page design.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic fieldset](#basic_fieldset)

This example includes a `` with a ``, with a single control inside it.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents self\-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption) element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Usually a `` is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
* A caption can be associated with the `` element by inserting a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption) inside it (as the first or the last child). The first `` element found in the figure is presented as the figure's caption.
* The `` provides the [accessible name](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_name) for the parent ``.

## <font> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/font)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines the font size, color and face for its content.

**Warning:**
Do not use this element. Use the CSS [Fonts](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts) properties to style text.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`color` 
Deprecated](#color)

This attribute sets the text color using either a named color or a color specified in the hexadecimal \#RRGGBB format.

[`face` 
Deprecated](#face)

This attribute contains a comma\-separated list of one or more font names. The document text in the default style is rendered in the first font face that the client's browser supports. If no font listed is installed on the local system, the browser typically defaults to the proportional or fixed\-width font for that system.

[`size` 
Deprecated](#size)

This attribute specifies the font size as either a numeric or relative value. Numeric values range from `1` to `7` with `1` being the smallest and `3` the default. It can be defined using a relative value, like `+2` or `-3`, which sets it relative to `3`, the default value.

## [DOM interface](#dom_interface)

This element implements the [`HTMLFontElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFontElement) interface.

## <footer>: The Footer element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor [sectioning content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories#sectioning_content) or [sectioning root](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#labeling_section_content) element. A `` typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Enclose information about the author in an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address) element that can be included into the `` element.
* When the nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element is the body element the footer applies to the whole page.
* The `` element is not sectioning content and therefore doesn't introduce a new section in the [outline](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements).
## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Prior to the release of Safari 13, the `contentinfo` [landmark role](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics#signpostslandmarks) was not properly exposed by [VoiceOver](https://help.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/). If needing to support legacy Safari browsers, add `role="contentinfo"` to the `footer` element to ensure the landmark will be properly exposed.

## <form>: The Form element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.

## [Try it](#try_it)

It is possible to use the [`:valid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:valid) and [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) CSS [pseudo\-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) to style a `` element based on whether the [`elements`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/elements "elements") inside the form are valid.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`accept` 
Deprecated](#accept)

Comma\-separated [content types](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Content_type) the server accepts.

**Note:** **This attribute has been deprecated and should not be used.** Instead, use the [`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#accept) attribute on `` elements.

[`accept-charset`](#accept-charset)

The [character encoding](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_encoding) accepted by the server.
The specification allows a single case\-insensitive value of `"UTF-8"`, reflecting the ubiquity of this encoding (historically multiple character encodings could be specified as a comma\-separated or space\-separated list).

[`autocapitalize`](#autocapitalize)

Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so, in what manner. See the [`autocapitalize`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocapitalize) global attribute page for more information.

[`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)

Indicates whether input elements can by default have their values automatically completed by the browser. `autocomplete` attributes on form elements override it on ``. Possible values:

* `off`: The browser may not automatically complete entries. (Browsers tend to ignore this for suspected login forms; see [Managing autofill for login fields](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Turning_off_form_autocompletion#managing_autofill_for_login_fields).)
* `on`: The browser may automatically complete entries.

[`name`](#name)

The name of the form. The value must not be the empty string, and must be unique among the `form` elements in the forms collection that it is in, if any.

[`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel)

Controls the annotations and what kinds of links the form creates. Annotations include [`external`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#external), [`nofollow`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#nofollow), [`opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#opener), [`noopener`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#noopener), and [`noreferrer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#noreferrer). Link types include [`help`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#help), [`prev`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#prev), [`next`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#next), [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#search), and [`license`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#license). The [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel) value is a space\-separated list of these enumerated values.

### [Attributes for form submission](#attributes_for_form_submission)

The following attributes control behavior during form submission.

[`action`](#action)

The URL that processes the form submission. This value can be overridden by a [`formaction`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#formaction) attribute on a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) element. This attribute is ignored when `method="dialog"` is set.

[`enctype`](#enctype)

If the value of the `method` attribute is `post`, `enctype` is the [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime_type) of the form submission. Possible values:

* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: The default value.
* `multipart/form-data`: Use this if the form contains [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements with `type=file`.
* `text/plain`: Useful for debugging purposes.

This value can be overridden by [`formenctype`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#formenctype) attributes on [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) elements.

[`method`](#method)

The [HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) method to submit the form with.
The only allowed methods/values are (case insensitive):

* `post`: The [`POST`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) method; form data sent as the [request body](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/body).
* `get` (default): The [`GET`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET); form data appended to the `action` URL with a `?` separator. Use this method when the form [has no side effects](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent).
* `dialog`: When the form is inside a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog), closes the dialog and causes a `submit` event to be fired on submission, without submitting data or clearing the form.

This value is overridden by [`formmethod`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#formmethod) attributes on [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) elements.

[`novalidate`](#novalidate)

This Boolean attribute indicates that the form shouldn't be validated when submitted. If this attribute is not set (and therefore the form ***is*** validated), it can be overridden by a [`formnovalidate`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#formnovalidate) attribute on a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) element belonging to the form.

[`target`](#target)

Indicates where to display the response after submitting the form. It is a name/keyword for a *browsing context* (for example, tab, window, or iframe). The following keywords have special meanings:

* `_self` (default): Load into the same browsing context as the current one.
* `_blank`: Load into a new unnamed browsing context. This provides the same behavior as setting [`rel="noopener"`](#rel) which does not set [`window.opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener).
* `_parent`: Load into the parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves the same as `_self`.
* `_top`: Load into the top\-level browsing context (i.e., the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has no parent). If no parent, behaves the same as `_self`.
* `_unfencedTop`: Load the response from a form inside an embedded [fenced frame](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fenced_frame_API) into the top\-level frame (i.e., traversing beyond the root of the fenced frame, unlike other reserved destinations). Only available inside fenced frames.

This value can be overridden by a [`formtarget`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#formtarget) attribute on a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) element.

## <frame> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset).

Using the `` element is not encouraged because of certain disadvantages such as performance problems and lack of accessibility for users with screen readers. Instead of the `` element, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) may be preferred.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`src` 
Deprecated](#src)

This attribute specifies the document that will be displayed by the frame.

[`name` 
Deprecated](#name)

This attribute is used for labeling frames. Without labeling, every link will open in the frame that it's in – the closest parent frame. See the [`target`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target) attribute for more information.

[`noresize` 
Deprecated](#noresize)

This attribute prevents resizing of frames by users.

[`scrolling` 
Deprecated](#scrolling)

This attribute defines the existence of a scrollbar. If this attribute is not used, the browser adds a scrollbar when necessary. There are two choices: "yes" for forcing a scrollbar even when it is not necessary and "no" for forcing no scrollbar even when it *is* necessary.

[`marginheight` 
Deprecated](#marginheight)

This attribute defines the height of the margin between frames.

[`marginwidth` 
Deprecated](#marginwidth)

This attribute defines the width of the margin between frames.

[`frameborder` 
Deprecated](#frameborder)

This attribute allows you to specify a frame's border.

## [Example](#example)

### [A frameset document](#a_frameset_document)

A frameset document has a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset) element instead of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) element. The `` elements are placed within the ``.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to contain [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame) elements.

**Note:**
Because the use of frames is now discouraged in favor of using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe), this element is not typically used by modern websites.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`cols` 
Deprecated](#cols)

This attribute specifies the number and size of horizontal spaces in a frameset.

[`rows`

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element contains machine\-readable information ([metadata](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Metadata)) about the document, like its [title](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title), [scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script), and [style sheets](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style). There can be only one `` element in an HTML document.

**Note:** `` primarily holds information for machine processing, not human\-readability. For human\-visible information, like top\-level headings and listed authors, see the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) element.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`profile`

## <header>: The Header element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element has an identical meaning to the site\-wide [`banner`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/banner_role) landmark role, unless nested within sectioning content. Then, the `` element is not a landmark.

The `` element can define a global site header, described as a `banner` in the accessibility tree. It usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.

Otherwise, it is a `section` in the accessibility tree, and usually contains the surrounding section's heading (an `h1` – `h6` element) and optional subheading, but this is **not** required.

### [Historical Usage](#historical_usage)

The `` element originally existed at the very beginning of HTML for headings. It is seen in [the very first website](https://info.cern.ch/). At some point, headings became [`` through ``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements), allowing `` to be free to fill a different role.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The `` element defines a [`banner`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/banner_role) landmark when its context is the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) element. The HTML header element is not considered a banner landmark when it is descendant of an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) element.

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hgroup)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a heading and related content. It groups a single [`–`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) element with one or more [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element allows the grouping of a heading with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or tagline. Each of these types of content represented as a `` element within the ``.

The `` itself has no impact on the document outline of a web page. Rather, the single allowed heading within the `` contributes to the document outline.

## <hr>: The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a thematic break between paragraph\-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.

## [Try it](#try_it)

Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element's attributes include the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`align` 
Deprecated

Non\-standard](#align)

Sets the alignment of the rule on the page. If no value is specified, the default value is `left`.

[`color`

## <html>: The HTML Document / Root element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the root (top\-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the *root element*. All other elements must be descendants of this element. There can be only one `` element in a document.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`version` 
Deprecated](#version)

Specifies the version of the HTML [Document Type Definition](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype) that governs the current document. This attribute is not needed, because it is redundant with the version information in the document type declaration.

[`xmlns`](#xmlns)

Specifies the [XML](/en-US/docs/Glossary/XML) [Namespace](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Namespace) of the document. Default value is `"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"`. This is required in documents parsed with XML [parsers](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Parser), and optional in text/html documents.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

While HTML does not require authors to specify `` element start and ending tags, it is important for authors to do so as it will allow them to specify the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) for the webpage. Providing a `lang` attribute with a valid language tag according to [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47\)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646) on the `` element will help screen reading technology determine the proper language to announce. The identifying language tag should describe the language used by the majority of the content of the page. Without it, screen readers will typically default to the operating system's set language, which may cause mispronunciations.

Including a valid `lang` declaration on the `` element also ensures that important metadata contained in the page's [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head), such as the page's [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title), are also announced properly.

## <i>: The Idiomatic Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the `` naming of this element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Use the `` element for text that is set off from the normal prose for readability reasons. This would be a range of text with different semantic meaning than the surrounding text. Among the use cases for the `` element are spans of text representing a different quality or mode of text, such as:

	+ Alternative voice or mood
	+ Taxonomic designations (such as the genus and species "*Homo sapiens*")
	+ Idiomatic terms from another language (such as "*et cetera*"); these should include the [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) attribute to identify the language
	+ Technical terms
	+ Transliterations
	+ Thoughts (such as "She wondered, *What is this writer talking about, anyway?*")
	+ Ship or vessel names in Western writing systems (such as "They searched the docks for the *Empress of the Galaxy*, the ship to which they were assigned.")
* In earlier versions of the HTML specification, the `` element was merely a presentational element used to display text in italics, much like the `` element was used to display text in bold letters. This is no longer true, as these tags now define semantics rather than typographic appearance. A browser will typically still display the contents of the `` element in italic type, but is, by definition, no longer required to do so. To display text in italic type, authors should use the CSS [`font-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style) property.
* Be sure the text in question is not actually more appropriately marked up with another element.

	+ Use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) to indicate stress emphasis.
	+ Use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) to indicate importance, seriousness, or urgency.
	+ Use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark) to indicate relevance.
	+ Use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite) to mark up the name of a work, such as a book, play, or song.
	+ Use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dfn) to mark up the defining instance of a term.
## [Examples](#examples)

This example demonstrates using the `` element to mark text that is in another language.

## <iframe>: The Inline Frame element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a nested [browsing context](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context), embedding another HTML page into the current one.

## [Try it](#try_it)

Each embedded browsing context has its own [document](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) and allows URL navigations. The navigations of each embedded browsing context are linearized into the [session history](/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) of the *topmost* browsing context. The browsing context that embeds the others is called the *parent browsing context*. The *topmost* browsing context — the one with no parent — is usually the browser window, represented by the [`Window`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) object.

**Warning:**
Because each browsing context is a complete document environment, every `` in a page requires increased memory and other computing resources. While theoretically you can use as many ``s as you like, check for performance problems.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`allow`](#allow)

Specifies a [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy) for the ``. The policy defines what features are available to the `` (for example, access to the microphone, camera, battery, web\-share, etc.) based on the origin of the request.

See [iframes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy#iframes) in the `Permissions-Policy` topic for examples.

**Note:**
A Permissions Policy specified by the `allow` attribute implements a further restriction on top of the policy specified in the [`Permissions-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy) header. It doesn't replace it.

[`allowfullscreen`](#allowfullscreen)

Set to `true` if the `` can activate fullscreen mode by calling the [`requestFullscreen()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/requestFullscreen "requestFullscreen()") method.

**Note:**
This attribute is considered a legacy attribute and redefined as `allow="fullscreen"`.

[`allowpaymentrequest` 
Deprecated

Non\-standard](#allowpaymentrequest)

Set to `true` if a cross\-origin `` should be allowed to invoke the [Payment Request API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API).

**Note:**
This attribute is considered a legacy attribute and redefined as `allow="payment"`.

[`browsingtopics` 
Experimental

Non\-standard](#browsingtopics)

A boolean attribute that, if present, specifies that the selected topics for the current user should be sent with the request for the ``'s source. See [Using the Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API/Using) for more details.

[`credentialless` 
Experimental](#credentialless)

Set to `true` to make the `` credentialless, meaning that its content will be loaded in a new, ephemeral context. It doesn't have access to the network, cookies, and storage data associated with its origin. It uses a new context local to the top\-level document lifetime. In return, the [`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) (COEP) embedding rules can be lifted, so documents with COEP set can embed third\-party documents that do not. See [IFrame credentialless](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/IFrame_credentialless) for more details.

[`csp` 
Experimental](#csp)

A [Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) enforced for the embedded resource. See [`HTMLIFrameElement.csp`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/csp) for details.

[`height`](#height)

The height of the frame in CSS pixels. Default is `150`.

[`loading`](#loading)

Indicates when the browser should load the iframe:

[`eager`](#eager)

Load the iframe immediately on page load (this is the default value).

[`lazy`](#lazy)

Defer loading of the iframe until it reaches a calculated distance from the [visual viewport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Visual_Viewport), as defined by the browser.
The intent is to avoid using the network and storage bandwidth required to fetch the frame until the browser is reasonably certain that it will be needed.
This improves the performance and cost in most typical use cases, in particular by reducing initial page load times.

**Note:**
Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled.
This is an anti\-tracking measure.

[`name`](#name)

A targetable name for the embedded browsing context. This can be used in the `target` attribute of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) elements; the `formtarget` attribute of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) elements; or the `windowName` parameter in the [`window.open()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open "window.open()") method.

[`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy)

Indicates which [referrer](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer) to send when fetching the frame's resource:

[`no-referrer`](#no-referrer)

The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent.

[`no-referrer-when-downgrade`](#no-referrer-when-downgrade)

The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent to [origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin)s without [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) ([HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS)).

[`origin`](#origin)

The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its [scheme](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), [host](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Host), and [port](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Port).

[`origin-when-cross-origin`](#origin-when-cross-origin)

The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.

[`same-origin`](#same-origin)

A referrer will be sent for [same origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy), but cross\-origin requests will contain no referrer information.

[`strict-origin`](#strict-origin)

Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).

[`strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (default)](#strict-origin-when-cross-origin)

Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).

[`unsafe-url`](#unsafe-url)

The referrer will include the origin *and* the path (but not the [fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/hash), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/password), or [username](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/username)). **This value is unsafe**, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS\-protected resources to insecure origins.

[`sandbox`](#sandbox)

Controls the restrictions applied to the content embedded in the ``. The value of the attribute can either be empty to apply all restrictions, or space\-separated tokens to lift particular restrictions:

[`allow-downloads`](#allow-downloads)

Allows downloading files through an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) element with the [download](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#download) attribute, as well as through the navigation that leads to a download of a file. This works regardless of whether the user clicked on the link, or JS code initiated it without user interaction.

[`allow-forms`](#allow-forms)

Allows the page to submit forms. If this keyword is not used, a form will be displayed as normal, but submitting it will not trigger input validation, send data to a web server, or close a dialog.

[`allow-modals`](#allow-modals)

Allows the page to open modal windows by [`Window.alert()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert), [`Window.confirm()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm), [`Window.print()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/print) and [`Window.prompt()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt), while opening a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) is allowed regardless of this keyword. It also allows the page to receive [`BeforeUnloadEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/BeforeUnloadEvent) event.

[`allow-orientation-lock`](#allow-orientation-lock)

Lets the resource [lock the screen orientation](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen/lockOrientation).

[`allow-pointer-lock`](#allow-pointer-lock)

Allows the page to use the [Pointer Lock API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API).

[`allow-popups`](#allow-popups)

Allows popups (like from [`Window.open()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open), `target="_blank"`, [`Window.showModalDialog()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showModalDialog)). If this keyword is not used, that functionality will silently fail.

[`allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`](#allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox)

Allows a sandboxed document to open a new browsing context without forcing the sandboxing flags upon it. This will allow, for example, a third\-party advertisement to be safely sandboxed without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad links to. If this flag is not included, a redirected page, popup window, or new tab will be subject to the same sandbox restrictions as the originating ``.

[`allow-presentation`](#allow-presentation)

Allows embedders to have control over whether an iframe can start a [presentation session](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PresentationRequest).

[`allow-same-origin`](#allow-same-origin)

If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the [same\-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy) (potentially preventing access to [data storage/cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#cross-origin_data_storage_access) and some JavaScript APIs).

[`allow-scripts`](#allow-scripts)

Allows the page to run scripts (but not create pop\-up windows). If this keyword is not used, this operation is not allowed.

[`allow-storage-access-by-user-activation` 
Experimental](#allow-storage-access-by-user-activation)

Allows a document loaded in the `` to use the [Storage Access API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API "Storage Access API") to request access to unpartitioned cookies.

[`allow-top-navigation`](#allow-top-navigation)

Lets the resource navigate the top\-level browsing context (the one named `_top`).

[`allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`](#allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation)

Lets the resource navigate the top\-level browsing context, but only if initiated by a user gesture.

[`allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols`](#allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols)

Allows navigations to non\-`http` protocols built into browser or [registered by a website](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler). This feature is also activated by `allow-popups` or `allow-top-navigation` keyword.

**Note:**

* When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding page, it is **strongly discouraged** to use both `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin`, as that lets the embedded document remove the `sandbox` attribute — making it no more secure than not using the `sandbox` attribute at all.
* Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content outside a sandboxed `iframe` — such as if the viewer opens the frame in a new tab. Such content should be also served from a *separate origin* to limit potential damage.

**Note:**
When redirecting the user, opening a popup window, or opening a new tab from an embedded page within an `` with the `sandbox` attribute, the new browsing context is subject to the same `sandbox` restrictions. This can create issues — for example, if a page embedded within an `` without a `sandbox="allow-forms"` or `sandbox="allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"` attribute set on it opens a new site in a separate tab, form submission in that new browsing context will silently fail.

[`src`](#src)

The URL of the page to embed. Use a value of `about:blank` to embed an empty page that conforms to the [same\-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#inherited_origins). Also note that programmatically removing an ``'s src attribute (e.g. via [`Element.removeAttribute()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute)) causes `about:blank` to be loaded in the frame in Firefox (from version 65\), Chromium\-based browsers, and Safari/iOS.

**Note:**
The `about:blank` page uses the embedding document's URL as its base URL when resolving any relative URLs, such as anchor links.

[`srcdoc`](#srcdoc)

Inline HTML to embed, overriding the `src` attribute. Its content should follow the syntax of a full HTML document, which includes the doctype directive, ``, `` tags, etc., although most of them can be omitted, leaving only the body content. This doc will have `about:srcdoc` as its location. If a browser does not support the `srcdoc` attribute, it will fall back to the URL in the `src` attribute.

**Note:**
The `about:srcdoc` page uses the embedding document's URL as its base URL when resolving any relative URLs, such as anchor links.

[`width`](#width)

The width of the frame in CSS pixels. Default is `300`.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

These attributes are deprecated and may no longer be supported by all user agents. You should not use them in new content, and try to remove them from existing content.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

The alignment of this element with respect to the surrounding context.

[`frameborder` 
Deprecated](#frameborder)

The value `1` (the default) draws a border around this frame. The value `0` removes the border around this frame, but you should instead use the CSS property [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) to control `` borders.

[`longdesc` 
Deprecated](#longdesc)

A URL of a long description of the frame's content. Due to widespread misuse, this is not helpful for non\-visual browsers.

[`marginheight` 
Deprecated](#marginheight)

The amount of space in pixels between the frame's content and its top and bottom borders.

[`marginwidth` 
Deprecated](#marginwidth)

The amount of space in pixels between the frame's content and its left and right borders.

[`scrolling` 
Deprecated](#scrolling)

Indicates when the browser should provide a scrollbar for the frame:

[`auto`](#auto)

Only when the frame's content is larger than its dimensions.

[`yes`](#yes)

Always show a scrollbar.

[`no`](#no)

Never show a scrollbar.

## [Scripting](#scripting)

Inline frames, like [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame) elements, are included in the [`window.frames`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/frames) pseudo\-array.

With the DOM [`HTMLIFrameElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement) object, scripts can access the [`window`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) object of the framed resource via the [`contentWindow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/contentWindow "contentWindow") property. The [`contentDocument`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/contentDocument "contentDocument") property refers to the `document` inside the ``, same as `contentWindow.document`.

From the inside of a frame, a script can get a reference to its parent window with [`window.parent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/parent).

Script access to a frame's content is subject to the [same\-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy). Scripts cannot access most properties in other `window` objects if the script was loaded from a different origin, including scripts inside a frame accessing the frame's parent. Cross\-origin communication can be achieved using [`Window.postMessage()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).

## [Positioning and scaling](#positioning_and_scaling)

Being a [replaced element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element), the `` allows the position of the embedded document within its box to be adjusted using the [`object-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property.

**Note:**
The [`object-fit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property has no effect on `` elements.

## [`error` and `load` event behavior](#error_and_load_event_behavior)

The `error` and `load` events fired on ``s could be used to probe the URL space of the local network's HTTP servers. Therefore, as a security precaution user agents do not fire the [error](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/error_event) event on ``s, and the [load](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/load_event) event is always triggered even if the `` content fails to load.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

People navigating with assistive technology such as a screen reader can use the [`title` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) on an `` to label its content. The title's value should concisely describe the embedded content:

html\`\`\`
\\

\`\`\`
Without this title, they have to navigate into the `` to determine what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and time\-consuming, especially for pages with multiple ``s and/or if embeds contain interactive content like video or audio.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [A basic \](#a_basic_iframe)

This example embeds the page at  in an iframe. This is a common use case of iframes: to embed content from another site. For example, the live sample itself, and the [try it](#try_it) example at the top, are both `` embeds of content from another MDN site.

### [Embedding source code in an \](#embedding_source_code_in_an_iframe)

This example directly renders source code in an iframe. This can be used as a technique to prevent script injection when displaying user\-generated content, when combined with the `sandbox` attribute.

Note that when using `srcdoc`, any relative URLs in the embedded content will be resolved relative to the URL of the embedding page. If you want to use anchor links that point to places in the embedded content, you need to explicitly specify `about:srcdoc` as the base URL.

Here's how to write escape sequences when using `srcdoc`:

* First, write the HTML out, escaping anything you would escape in a normal HTML document (such as ``, `&`, etc.).
* `<` and `<` represent the exact same character in the `srcdoc` attribute. Therefore, to make it an actual escape sequence in the HTML document, replace any ampersands (`&`) with `&amp;`. For example, `<` becomes `&amp;lt;`, and `&amp;` becomes `&amp;amp;`.
* Replace any double quotes (`"`) with `&quot;` to prevent the `srcdoc` attribute from being prematurely terminated (if you use `'` instead, then you should replace `'` with `&apos;` instead). This step happens after the previous one, so `&quot;` generated in this step doesn't become `&amp;quot;`.

## <img>: The Image Embed element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds an image into the document.

## [Try it](#try_it)

The above example shows usage of the `` element:

* The `src` attribute is **required**, and contains the path to the image you want to embed.
* The `alt` attribute holds a textual replacement for the image, which is mandatory and **incredibly useful** for accessibility — screen readers read the attribute value out to their users so they know what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, or link rot.

There are many other attributes to achieve various purposes:

* [Referrer](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)/[CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) control for security and privacy: see [`crossorigin`](#crossorigin) and [`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy).
* Use both [`width`](#width) and [`height`](#height) to set the intrinsic size of the image, allowing it to take up space before it loads, to mitigate content layout shifts.
* Responsive image hints with [`sizes`](#sizes) and [`srcset`](#srcset) (see also the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element and our [Responsive images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images) tutorial).
## [Supported image formats](#supported_image_formats)

The HTML standard doesn't list what image formats to support, so [user agents](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) may support different formats.

**Note:**
The [Image file type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) provides comprehensive information about image formats and their web browser support.
This section is just a summary!

The image file formats that are most commonly used on the web are:

* [APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#apng_animated_portable_network_graphics) — Good choice for lossless animation sequences (GIF is less performant)
* [AVIF (AV1 Image File Format)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) — Good choice for both images and animated images due to high performance.
* [GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#gif_graphics_interchange_format) — Good choice for *simple* images and animations.
* [JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group image)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#jpeg_joint_photographic_experts_group_image) — Good choice for lossy compression of still images (currently the most popular).
* [PNG (Portable Network Graphics)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#png_portable_network_graphics) — Good choice for lossless compression of still images (slightly better quality than JPEG).
* [SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#svg_scalable_vector_graphics) — Vector image format. Use for images that must be drawn accurately at different sizes.
* [WebP (Web Picture format)](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) — Excellent choice for both images and animated images

Formats like [WebP](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) and [AVIF](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) are recommended as they perform much better than PNG, JPEG, GIF for both still and animated images.

SVG remains the recommended format for images that must be drawn accurately at different sizes.

## [Image loading errors](#image_loading_errors)

If an error occurs while loading or rendering an image, and an `onerror` event handler has been set for the [`error`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/error_event "error") event, that event handler will get called. This can happen in several situations, including:

* The `src` attribute is empty (`""`) or `null`.
* The `src` [URL](/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL) is the same as the URL of the page the user is currently on.
* The image is corrupted in some way that prevents it from being loaded.
* The image's metadata is corrupted in such a way that it's impossible to retrieve its dimensions, and no dimensions were specified in the `` element's attributes.
* The image is in a format not supported by the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent).
## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`alt`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt#usage_notes)

Defines text that can replace the image in the page.

**Note:**
Browsers do not always display images. There are a number of situations in which a browser might not display images, such as:

* Non\-visual browsers (such as those used by people with visual impairments)
* The user chooses not to display images (saving bandwidth, privacy reasons)
* The image is invalid or an [unsupported type](#supported_image_formats)

In these cases, the browser may replace the image with the text in the element's `alt` attribute. For these reasons and others, provide a useful value for `alt` whenever possible.

Setting this attribute to an empty string (`alt=""`) indicates that this image is *not* a key part of the content (it's decoration or a tracking pixel), and that non\-visual browsers may omit it from [rendering](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Engine/Rendering). Visual browsers will also hide the broken image icon if the `alt` attribute is empty and the image failed to display.

This attribute is also used when copying and pasting the image to text, or saving a linked image to a bookmark.

[`attributionsrc` 
Experimental](#attributionsrc)

specifies that you want the browser to send an [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header along with the image request.

On the server\-side this is used to trigger sending an [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) or [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger) header in the response, to register an image\-based [attribution source](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_sources#html-based_event_sources) or [attribution trigger](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_triggers#html-based_attribution_triggers), respectively. Which response header should be sent back depends on the value of the `Attribution-Reporting-Eligible` header that triggered the registration.

The corresponding source or trigger event is set off once the browser receives the response containing the image file.

**Note:**
See the [Attribution Reporting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API) for more details.

There are two versions of this attribute that you can set:

* Boolean, i.e. just the `attributionsrc` name. This specifies that you want the [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header sent to the same server as the `src` attribute points to. This is fine when you are handling the attribution source or trigger registration on the same server. When registering an attribution trigger this property is optional, and a boolean value will be used if it is omitted.
* Value containing one or more URLs, for example:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of `attributionsrc`. When the resource request occurs the [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in `attributionSrc` in addition to the resource origin. These URLs can then respond with a [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) or [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger) header as appropriate to complete registration.

**Note:**
Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.

[`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin)

Indicates if the fetching of the image must be done using a [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) request. Image data from a [CORS\-enabled image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image) returned from a CORS request can be reused in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element without being marked "[tainted](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image#security_and_tainted_canvases)".

If the `crossorigin` attribute is *not* specified, then a non\-CORS request is sent (without the [`Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) request header), and the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data, preventing its usage in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) elements.

If the `crossorigin` attribute *is* specified, then a CORS request is sent (with the [`Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) request header); but if the server does not opt into allowing cross\-origin access to the image data by the origin site (by not sending any [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) response header, or by not including the site's origin in any [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) response header it does send), then the browser blocks the image from loading, and logs a CORS error to the devtools console.

Allowed values:

[`anonymous`](#anonymous)

A CORS request is sent with credentials omitted (that is, no [cookies](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cookie), [X.509 certificates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280), or [`Authorization`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) request header).

[`use-credentials`](#use-credentials)

The CORS request is sent with any credentials included (that is, cookies, X.509 certificates, and the `Authorization` request header). If the server does not opt into sharing credentials with the origin site (by sending back the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` response header), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data.

If the attribute has an invalid value, browsers handle it as if the `anonymous` value was used. See [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) for additional information.

[`decoding`](#decoding)

This attribute provides a hint to the browser as to whether it should perform image decoding along with rendering the other DOM content in a single presentation step that looks more "correct" (`sync`), or render and present the other DOM content first and then decode the image and present it later (`async`). In practice, `async` means that the next paint does not wait for the image to decode.

It is often difficult to perceive any noticeable effect when using `decoding` on static `` elements. They'll likely be initially rendered as empty images while the image files are fetched (either from the network or from the cache) and then handled independently anyway, so the "syncing" of content updates is less apparent. However, the blocking of rendering while decoding happens, while often quite small, *can* be measured — even if it is difficult to observe with the human eye. See [What does the image decoding attribute actually do?](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/what-does-the-image-decoding-attribute-actually-do/) for a more detailed analysis (tunetheweb.com, 2023\).

Using different `decoding` types can result in more noticeable differences when dynamically inserting `` elements into the DOM via JavaScript — see [`HTMLImageElement.decoding`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/decoding) for more details.

Allowed values:

[`sync`](#sync)

Decode the image synchronously along with rendering the other DOM content, and present everything together.

[`async`](#async)

Decode the image asynchronously, after rendering and presenting the other DOM content.

[`auto`](#auto)

No preference for the decoding mode; the browser decides what is best for the user. This is the default value.

[`elementtiming`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/elementtiming)

Marks the image for observation by the [`PerformanceElementTiming`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceElementTiming) API. The value given becomes an identifier for the observed image element. See also the [`elementtiming`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/elementtiming) attribute page.

[`fetchpriority`](#fetchpriority)

Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching the image.
Allowed values:

[`high`](#high)

Fetch the image at a high priority relative to other images.

[`low`](#low)

Fetch the image at a low priority relative to other images.

[`auto`](#auto_2)

Don't set a preference for the fetch priority.
This is the default.
It is used if no value or an invalid value is set.

See [`HTMLImageElement.fetchPriority`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/fetchPriority) for more information.

[`height`](#height)

The intrinsic height of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.

**Note:**
Including `height` and [`width`](#width) enables the [aspect ratio](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Aspect_ratio) of the image to be calculated by the browser prior to the image being loaded. This aspect ratio is used to reserve the space needed to display the image, reducing or even preventing a layout shift when the image is downloaded and painted to the screen. Reducing layout shift is a major component of good user experience and web performance.

[`ismap`](#ismap)

This Boolean attribute indicates that the image is part of a [server\-side map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map#Server-side). If so, the coordinates where the user clicked on the image are sent to the server.

**Note:**
This attribute is allowed only if the `` element is a descendant of an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) element with a valid [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#href) attribute. This gives users without pointing devices a fallback destination.

[`loading`](#loading)

Indicates how the browser should load the image:

[`eager`](#eager)

Loads the image immediately, regardless of whether or not the image is currently within the visible viewport (this is the default value).

[`lazy`](#lazy)

Defers loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport, as defined by the browser. The intent is to avoid the network and storage bandwidth needed to handle the image until it's reasonably certain that it will be needed. This generally improves the performance of the content in most typical use cases.

**Note:**
Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is an anti\-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.

**Note:**
Images with `loading` set to `lazy` will never be loaded if they do not intersect a visible part of an element, even if loading them would change that as unloaded images have a `width` and `height` of `0`. Putting `width` and `height` on lazy\-loaded images fixes this issue and is a best practice, [recommended by the specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-img-element). Doing so also helps prevent layout shifts.

[`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy)

A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource:

* `no-referrer`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent.
* `no-referrer-when-downgrade`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent to [origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin)s without [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) ([HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS)).
* `origin`: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its [scheme](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), [host](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Host), and [port](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Port).
* `origin-when-cross-origin`: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
* `same-origin`: A referrer will be sent for [same origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy), but cross\-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
* `strict-origin`: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (default): Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `unsafe-url`: The referrer will include the origin *and* the path (but not the [fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/hash), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/password), or [username](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/username)). **This value is unsafe**, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS\-protected resources to insecure origins.

[`sizes`](#sizes)

One or more strings separated by commas, indicating a set of source sizes. Each source size consists of:

1. A [media condition](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries#syntax). This must be omitted for the last item in the list.
2. A source size value.

Media Conditions describe properties of the *viewport*, not of the *image*. For example, `(max-height: 500px) 1000px` proposes to use a source of 1000px width, if the *viewport* is not higher than 500px.

Source size values specify the intended display size of the image. [User agents](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) use the current source size to select one of the sources supplied by the `srcset` attribute, when those sources are described using width (`w`) descriptors. The selected source size affects the [intrinsic size](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size) of the image (the image's display size if no [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) styling is applied). If the `srcset` attribute is absent, or contains no values with a width descriptor, then the `sizes` attribute has no effect.

[`src`](#src)

The image [URL](/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL). Mandatory for the `` element. On [browsers](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser) supporting `srcset`, `src` is treated like a candidate image with a pixel density descriptor `1x`, unless an image with this pixel density descriptor is already defined in `srcset`, or unless `srcset` contains `w` descriptors.

[`srcset`](#srcset)

One or more strings separated by commas, indicating possible image sources for the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) to use. Each string is composed of:

1. A [URL](/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL) to an image
2. Optionally, whitespace followed by one of:

	* A width descriptor (a positive integer directly followed by `w`). The width descriptor is divided by the source size given in the `sizes` attribute to calculate the effective pixel density.
	* A pixel density descriptor (a positive floating point number directly followed by `x`).

If no descriptor is specified, the source is assigned the default descriptor of `1x`.

It is incorrect to mix width descriptors and pixel density descriptors in the same `srcset` attribute. Duplicate descriptors (for instance, two sources in the same `srcset` which are both described with `2x`) are also invalid.

If the `srcset` attribute uses width descriptors, the `sizes` attribute must also be present, or the `srcset` itself will be ignored.

The user agent selects any of the available sources at its discretion. This provides them with significant leeway to tailor their selection based on things like user preferences or [bandwidth](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Bandwidth) conditions. See our [Responsive images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images) tutorial for an example.

[`width`](#width)

The intrinsic width of the image in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.

[`usemap`](#usemap)

The partial [URL](/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL) (starting with `#`) of an [image map](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) associated with the element.

**Note:**
You cannot use this attribute if the `` element is inside an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) element.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Aligns the image with its surrounding context. Use the [`float`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) and/or [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) properties instead of this attribute. Allowed values:

[`top`](#top)

Equivalent to `vertical-align: top` or `vertical-align: text-top`

[`middle`](#middle)

Equivalent to `vertical-align: -moz-middle-with-baseline`

[`bottom`](#bottom)

The default, equivalent to `vertical-align: unset` or `vertical-align: initial`

[`left`](#left)

Equivalent to `float: left`

[`right`](#right)

Equivalent to `float: right`

[`border` 
Deprecated](#border)

The width of a border around the image. Use the [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) property instead.

[`hspace` 
Deprecated](#hspace)

The number of pixels of white space on the left and right of the image. Use the [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) CSS property instead.

[`longdesc` 
Deprecated](#longdesc)

A link to a more detailed description of the image. Possible values are a [URL](/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL) or an element [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id).

**Note:**
This attribute is mentioned in the latest [W3C](/en-US/docs/Glossary/W3C) version, [HTML 5\.2](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/obsolete.html#element-attrdef-img-longdesc), but has been removed from the [WHATWG](/en-US/docs/Glossary/WHATWG)'s [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-img-element). It has an uncertain future; authors should use a [WAI](/en-US/docs/Glossary/WAI)\-[ARIA](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ARIA) alternative such as [`aria-describedby`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby) or [`aria-details`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-details).

[`name` 
Deprecated](#name)

A name for the element. Use the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute instead.

[`vspace` 
Deprecated](#vspace)

The number of pixels of white space above and below the image. Use the [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) CSS property instead.

## [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

`` is a [replaced element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element); it has a [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) value of `inline` by default, but its default dimensions are defined by the embedded image's intrinsic values, like it were `inline-block`. You can set properties like [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)/[`border-radius`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius), [`padding`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding)/[`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin), [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width), [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height), etc. on an image.

`` has no baseline, so when images are used in an inline formatting context with [`vertical-align: baseline`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align), the bottom of the image will be placed on the text baseline.

You can use the [`object-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property to position the image within the element's box, and the [`object-fit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property to adjust the sizing of the image within the box (for example, whether the image should fit the box or fill it even if clipping is required).

Depending on its type, an image may have an intrinsic width and height. For some image types, however, intrinsic dimensions are unnecessary. [SVG](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SVG) images, for instance, have no intrinsic dimensions if their root [``](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/svg) element doesn't have a `width` or `height` set on it.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Authoring meaningful alternate descriptions](#authoring_meaningful_alternate_descriptions)

An `alt` attribute's value should provide a clear and concise text replacement for the image's content. It should not describe the presence of the image itself or the file name of the image. If the `alt` attribute is purposefully left off because the image has no textual equivalent, consider alternate methods to present what the image is trying to communicate.

#### Don't

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
#### Do

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
An important accessibility test is to read the `alt` attribute content together with preceding textual content to see if it conveys the same meaning as the image. For example, if the image was preceded by the sentence "On my travels, I saw a cute little animal:", the *Don't* example could be read by a screen reader as "On my travels, I saw a cute little animal: image", which doesn't make sense. The *Do* example could be read by a screen reader as "On my travels, I saw a cute little animal: A Penguin on a beach.", which does make sense.

For images used to trigger an action, for example, images nested inside an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) element, consider describing the triggered action inside the `alt` attribute value. For example, you could write `alt="next page"` instead of `alt="arrow right"`. You could also consider adding an optional further description inside a `title` attribute; this may be read by screen readers if requested by the user.

When an `alt` attribute is not present on an image, some screen readers may announce the image's file name instead. This can be a confusing experience if the file name isn't representative of the image's contents.

### [Identifying SVG as an image](#identifying_svg_as_an_image)

Due to a [VoiceOver bug](https://webkit.org/b/216364), VoiceOver does not correctly announce SVG images as images. Include [`role="img"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/img_role) to all `` elements with SVG source files to ensure assistive technologies correctly announce the SVG as image content.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`### [The title attribute](#the_title_attribute)

The [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) attribute is not an acceptable substitute for the `alt` attribute. Additionally, avoid duplicating the `alt` attribute's value in a `title` attribute declared on the same image. Doing so may cause some screen readers to announce the same text twice, creating a confusing experience.

The `title` attribute should also not be used as supplemental captioning information to accompany an image's `alt` description. If an image needs a caption, use the [`figure`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure) and [`figcaption`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption) elements.

The value of the `title` attribute is usually presented to the user as a tooltip, which appears shortly after the cursor stops moving over the image. While this *can* provide additional information to the user, you should not assume that the user will ever see it: the user may only have keyboard or touchscreen. If you have information that's particularly important or valuable for the user, present it inline using one of the methods mentioned above instead of using `title`.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Alternative text](#alternative_text)

The following example embeds an image into the page and includes alternative text for accessibility.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
### [Image link](#image_link)

This example builds upon the previous one, showing how to turn the image into a link. To do so, nest the `` tag inside the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a). You should make the alternative text describe the resource the link is pointing to, as if you were using a text link instead.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
\

\`\`\`
### [Using the srcset attribute](#using_the_srcset_attribute)

In this example we include a `srcset` attribute with a reference to a high\-resolution version of the logo; this will be loaded instead of the `src` image on high\-resolution devices. The image referenced in the `src` attribute is counted as a `1x` candidate in [user agents](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) that support `srcset`.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
### [Using the srcset and sizes attributes](#using_the_srcset_and_sizes_attributes)

The `src` attribute is ignored in [user agents](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) that support `srcset` when `w` descriptors are included. When the `(max-width: 600px)` media condition matches, the 200 pixel\-wide image will load (it is the one that matches `200px` most closely), otherwise the other image will load.

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`

**Note:**
To see the resizing in action, [view the example on a separate page](#livesample_fullscreen=using_the_srcset_and_sizes_attributes), so you can actually resize the content area.

## [Security and privacy concerns](#security_and_privacy_concerns)

Although `` elements have innocent uses, they can have undesirable consequences for user security and privacy. See [Referer header: privacy and security concerns](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns) for more information and mitigations.

## <input>: The HTML Input element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to create interactive controls for web\-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent). The `` element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [\ types](#input_types)

How an `` works varies considerably depending on the value of its [`type`](#type) attribute, hence the different types are covered in their own separate reference pages. If this attribute is not specified, the default type adopted is `text`.

The available types are as follows:

| Type | Description | Basic Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [button](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/button) | A push button with no default behavior displaying the value of the [`value`](#value) attribute, empty by default. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) | A check box allowing single values to be selected/deselected. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [color](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color) | A control for specifying a color; opening a color picker when active in supporting browsers. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [date](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) | A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time).  Opens a date picker or numeric wheels for year, month, day when active  in supporting browsers. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [datetime\-local](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) | A control for entering a date and time, with no time zone. Opens a date  picker or numeric wheels for date\- and time\-components when active in supporting browsers. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email) | A field for editing an email address. Looks like a  `text` input, but has validation parameters and relevant  keyboard in supporting browsers and devices with dynamic keyboards. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) | A control that lets the user select a file.  Use the [`accept`](#accept) attribute to define the types of files that the control can select. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [hidden](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden) | A control that is not displayed but whose value is submitted to the  server. There is an example in the next column, but it's hidden! | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) | A graphical `submit` button. Displays an image defined by the `src` attribute.  The [`alt`](#alt) attribute displays if the image [`src`](#src) is missing. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [month](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month) | A control for entering a month and year, with no time zone. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [number](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number) | A control for entering a number. Displays a spinner and adds default  validation. Displays a numeric keypad in some devices  with dynamic keypads. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [password](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password) | A single\-line text field whose value is obscured.  Will alert user if site is not secure. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [radio](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) | A radio button, allowing a single value to be selected out of multiple choices with the same [`name`](#name) value. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [range](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) | A control for entering a number whose exact value is not important.  Displays as a range widget defaulting to the middle value.  Used in conjunction [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max) to define the range of acceptable values. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [reset](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/reset) | A button that resets the contents of the form to default values. Not recommended. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [search](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search) | A single\-line text field for entering search strings. Line\-breaks are  automatically removed from the input value. May include a delete icon in  supporting browsers that can be used to clear the field. Displays a  search icon instead of enter key on some devices with dynamic keypads. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) | A button that submits the form. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [tel](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel) | A control for entering a telephone number. Displays a telephone keypad  in some devices with dynamic keypads. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [text](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text) | The default value. A single\-line text field. Line\-breaks are  automatically removed from the input value. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [time](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time) | A control for entering a time value with no time zone. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [url](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url) | A field for entering a URL. Looks like a `text` input, but  has validation parameters and relevant keyboard in supporting browsers  and devices with dynamic keyboards. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| [week](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week) | A control for entering a date consisting of a week\-year number and a week number with no time zone. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |
| Obsolete values | | |
| `datetime`  Deprecated | A control for entering a date and time (hour, minute, second, and fraction of a second) based on UTC time zone. | \`\`\`  \ \`\`\` |

## [Attributes](#attributes)

The `` element is so powerful because of its attributes; the [`type`](#type) attribute, described with examples above, being the most important. Since every `` element, regardless of type, is based on the [`HTMLInputElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) interface, they technically share the exact same set of attributes. However, in reality, most attributes have an effect on only a specific subset of input types. In addition, the way some attributes impact an input depends on the input type, impacting different input types in different ways.

This section provides a table listing all the attributes with a brief description. This table is followed by a list describing each attribute in greater detail, along with which input types they are associated with. Those that are common to most or all input types are defined in greater detail below. Attributes that are unique to particular input types—or attributes which are common to all input types but have special behaviors when used on a given input type—are instead documented on those types' pages.

Attributes for the `` element include the [global HTML attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) and additionally:

| Attribute | Type(s) | Description |

A few additional non\-standard attributes are listed following the descriptions of the standard attributes.

### [Individual attributes](#individual_attributes)

[`accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept)

Valid for the `file` input type only, the `accept` attribute defines which file types are selectable in a `file` upload control. See the [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) input type.

[`alt`](#alt)

Valid for the `image` button only, the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image, displaying the value of the attribute if the image [`src`](#src) is missing or otherwise fails to load. See the [image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) input type.

[`autocapitalize`](#autocapitalize)

Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so, in what manner. See the [`autocapitalize`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocapitalize) global attribute page for more information.

[`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)

(**Not** a Boolean attribute!) The [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) attribute takes as its value a space\-separated string that describes what, if any, type of autocomplete functionality the input should provide. A typical implementation of autocomplete recalls previous values entered in the same input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser could integrate with a device's contacts list to autocomplete `email` addresses in an email input field. See [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#values) for permitted values.

The `autocomplete` attribute is valid on `hidden`, `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, `range`, `color`, and `password`. This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data, being valid for all input types except `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`, or any of the button types.

See the [`autocomplete` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) for additional information, including information on password security and how `autocomplete` is slightly different for `hidden` than for other input types.

[`autofocus`](#autofocus)

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading (or when the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) containing the element has been displayed).

**Note:**
An element with the `autofocus` attribute may gain focus before the [`DOMContentLoaded`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event "DOMContentLoaded") event is fired.

No more than one element in the document may have the `autofocus` attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus.

The `autofocus` attribute cannot be used on inputs of type `hidden`, since hidden inputs cannot be focused.

**Warning:**
Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually\-impaired people using screen\-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When `autofocus` is assigned, screen\-readers "teleport" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand.

Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the `autofocus` attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content.

[`capture`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture)

Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the `file` input type only, the `capture` attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with `file` upload control in supporting scenarios. See the [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) input type.

[`checked`](#checked)

Valid for both `radio` and `checkbox` types, `checked` is a Boolean attribute. If present on a `radio` type, it indicates that the radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same\-named radio buttons. If present on a `checkbox` type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does *not* indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox's state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the [`HTMLInputElement`'s `checked` IDL attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) is updated.)

**Note:**
Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently `checked`. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted.

For example, if a checkbox whose `name` is `fruit` has a `value` of `cherry`, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include `fruit=cherry`. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed in the form data at all. The default `value` for checkboxes and radio buttons is `on`.

[`dirname`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/dirname)

Valid for `hidden`, `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, and `email` input types, the `dirname` attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the [`name`](#name) and [`value`](#value), and the second being the value of the `dirname` attribute as the name, with a value of `ltr` or `rtl` as set by the browser.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 Fruit:
 \
 \
 \
\
\

\`\`\`
When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the `name` / `value` pair of `fruit=cherry` and the `dirname` / direction pair of `fruit-dir=ltr` to be sent.
For more information, see the [`dirname` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/dirname).

[`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use.

Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the [`click`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event "click") event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form.

**Note:**
Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default [persist the dynamic disabled state](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5985839/bug-with-firefox-disabled-attribute-of-input-not-resetting-when-refreshing) of an `` across page loads. Use the [`autocomplete`](#autocomplete) attribute to control this feature.

[`form`](#form)

A string specifying the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element with which the input is associated (that is, its **form owner**). This string's value, if present, must match the [`id`](#id) of a `` element in the same document. If this attribute isn't specified, the `` element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any.

The `form` attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document.

**Note:**
An input can only be associated with one form.

[`formaction`](#formaction)

Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) input type for more information.

[`formenctype`](#formenctype)

Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) input type for more information.

[`formmethod`](#formmethod)

Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) input type for more information.

[`formnovalidate`](#formnovalidate)

Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) input type for more information.

[`formtarget`](#formtarget)

Valid for the `image` and `submit` input types only. See the [submit](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/submit) input type for more information.

[`height`](#height)

Valid for the `image` input button only, the `height` is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the [image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) input type.

[`id`](#id)

Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)'s `for` attribute to link the label with the form control. See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label).

[`inputmode`](#inputmode)

Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include `none`, `text`, `tel`, `url`, `email`, `numeric`, `decimal`, and `search`.

[`list`](#list)

The value given to the `list` attribute should be the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/id "id") of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) element located in the same document. The `` provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the [`type`](#type) are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.

It is valid on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, `range`, and `color`.

Per the specifications, the `list` attribute is not supported by the `hidden`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`, or any of the button types.

Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even an input that opens like a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) but allows for non\-listed values. Check out the [browser compatibility table](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist#browser_compatibility) for the other input types.

See the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) element.

[`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max)

Valid for `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `range`, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the [`value`](#value) entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value.

There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of `max` may be lower than the value of `min`, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

[`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength)

Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password`, it defines the maximum string length (measured in UTF\-16 code units) that the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than `maxlength` UTF\-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the `maxlength` attribute. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user. See [Client\-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

[`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min)

Valid for `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `range`, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the [`value`](#value) entered into the element is less than this, the element fails [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `min` attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the `max` attribute. If the `min` attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no `min` value is applied. If the `min` attribute is valid and a non\-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the `min` attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See [Client\-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of `max` may be lower than the value of `min`, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

[`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/minlength)

Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password`, it defines the minimum string length (measured in UTF\-16 code units) that the user can enter into the entry field. This must be a non\-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length.

The input will fail [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation) if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than `minlength` UTF\-16 code units long, preventing form submission. Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the user. See [Client\-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

[`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/multiple)

The Boolean `multiple` attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the `file` input. See the [email](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email) and [file](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) input type.

[`name`](#name)

A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's value when the form data is submitted.

Consider the `name` a required attribute (even though it's not). If an input has no `name` specified, or `name` is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.)

There are two special cases:

1. `_charset_` : If used as the name of an `` element of type [hidden](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden), the input's `value` is automatically set by the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) to the character encoding being used to submit the form.
2. `isindex`: For historical reasons, the name [`isindex`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#attr-fe-name) is not allowed.

The [`name`](#name) attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons.

Only one radio button in a same\-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently\-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted,

When tabbing into a series of same\-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached.

Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order.

When an input element is given a `name`, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's [`HTMLFormElement.elements`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/elements) property. If you have an input whose `name` is set to `guest` and another whose `name` is `hat-size`, the following code can be used:

js\`\`\`
let form = document.querySelector("form");

let guestName = form.elements.guest;
let hatSize = form.elements\["hat\-size"];

\`\`\`
When this code has run, `guestName` will be the [`HTMLInputElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) for the `guest` field, and `hatSize` the object for the `hat-size` field.

**Warning:**
Avoid giving form elements a `name` that corresponds to a built\-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input.

[`pattern`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern)

Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password`, the `pattern` attribute is used to compile a regular expression that the input's [`value`](#value) must match in order for the value to pass [constraint validation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation). It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the [`RegExp`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) type, and as documented in our [guide on regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions). No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. When compiling the regular expression:

1. the pattern will be implicitly wrapped with `^(?:` and `)$`, such that the match is required against the *entire* input value, i.e., `^(?:)$`.
2. the `'v'` flag is specified so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as [ASCII](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ASCII).

If the `pattern` attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non\-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. If the [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/multiple) is present, the compiled regular expression is matched against each comma separated value.

**Note:**
If using the `pattern` attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a [`title`](#title) attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement.

See [Client\-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

[`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/placeholder)

Valid for `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `password`, and `number`, the `placeholder` attribute provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data, rather than an explanation or prompt. The text *must not* include carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is "First Name", a suitable placeholder might be "e.g. Mustafa".

**Note:**
The `placeholder` attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See [Labels](#labels) for more information.

[`popovertarget`](#popovertarget)

Turns an `` element into a popover control button; takes the ID of the popover element to control as its value. See the [Popover API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API "Popover API") landing page for more details.

[`popovertargetaction`](#popovertargetaction)

Specifies the action to be performed on a popover element being controlled by a control ``. Possible values are:

[`"hide"`](#hide)

The button will hide a shown popover. If you try to hide an already hidden popover, no action will be taken.

[`"show"`](#show)

The button will show a hidden popover. If you try to show an already showing popover, no action will be taken.

[`"toggle"`](#toggle)

The button will toggle a popover between showing and hidden. If the popover is hidden, it will be shown; if the popover is showing, it will be hidden. If `popovertargetaction` is omitted, `"toggle"` is the default action that will be performed by the control button.

[`readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly)

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The `readonly` attribute is supported by the `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `password` input types.

See the [HTML attribute: `readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

[`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required)

`required` is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The `required` attribute is supported by `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, and `file` inputs.

See [Client\-side validation](#client-side_validation) and the [HTML attribute: `required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required) for more information.

[`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/size)

Valid for `email`, `password`, `tel`, `url`, and `text`, the `size` attribute specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) property with a few specialties. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For `password` and `text`, it is a number of characters (or `em` units) with a default value of `20`, and for others, it is pixels (or `px` units). CSS `width` takes precedence over the `size` attribute.

[`src`](#src)

Valid for the `image` input button only, the `src` is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the [image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) input type.

[`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/step)

Valid for `date`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `number`, and `range`, the [`step`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/step) attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to.

If not explicitly included:

* `step` defaults to 1 for `number` and `range`.
* Each date/time input type has a default `step` value appropriate for the type; see the individual input pages: [`date`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date#step), [`datetime-local`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local#step), [`month`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/month#step), [`time`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/time#step), and [`week`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week#step).

The value must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value `any`, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max)).

If `any` is not explicitly set, valid values for the `number`, date/time input types, and `range` input types are equal to the basis for stepping — the [`min`](#min) value and increments of the step value, up to the [`max`](#max) value, if specified.

For example, if you have ``, then any even integer, `10` or greater, is valid. If omitted, ``, any integer is valid, but floats (like `4.2`) are not valid, because `step` defaults to `1`. For `4.2` to be valid, `step` would have had to be set to `any`, 0\.1, 0\.2, or any the `min` value would have had to be a number ending in `.2`, such as ``

**Note:**
When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation and will match the `:invalid` pseudoclass.

See [Client\-side validation](#client-side_validation) for more information.

[`tabindex`](#tabindex)

Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly.

[`title`](#title)

Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element with a `for` attribute set to the form control's [`id`](#id) attribute. See [Labels](#labels) below.

[`type`](#type)

A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of `checkbox` is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type `text` is used, creating a plaintext input field.

Permitted values are listed in [Input types](#input_types) above.

[`value`](#value)

The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective [`HTMLInputElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) object's `value` property. The `value` attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for `checkbox`, `radio`, and `hidden`.

[`width`](#width)

Valid for the `image` input button only, the `width` is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the [image](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/image) input type.

### [Non\-standard attributes](#non-standard_attributes)

The following non\-standard attributes are also available on some browsers. As a general rule, you should avoid using them unless it can't be helped.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`incremental`](#incremental) | Whether or not to send repeated [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/search_event "search") events to allow updating live search results while the user is still editing the value of the field.  **WebKit and Blink only (Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc.).** |
| `mozactionhint`  Deprecated | A string indicating the type of action that will be taken when the user  presses the `Enter` or `Return` key while editing the  field; this is used to determine an appropriate label for that key on a  virtual keyboard. **Since this attribute is deprecated, use [`enterkeyhint`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/enterkeyhint) instead.** |
| [`orient`](#orient) | Sets the orientation of the range slider. **Firefox only**. |
| [`results`](#results) | The maximum number of items that should be displayed in the drop\-down list of previous search queries. **Safari only.** |
| [`webkitdirectory`](#webkitdirectory) | A Boolean indicating whether to only allow the user to choose a directory (or directories, if [`multiple`](#multiple) is also present) |

[`incremental` 
Non\-standard](#incremental)

The Boolean attribute `incremental` is a WebKit and Blink extension (so supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present, tells the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) to process the input as a live search. As the user edits the value of the field, the user agent sends [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/search_event "search") events to the [`HTMLInputElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) object representing the search box. This allows your code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the search.

If `incremental` is not specified, the [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/search_event "search") event is only sent when the user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the `Enter` or `Return` key while editing the field).

The `search` event is rate\-limited so that it is not sent more frequently than an implementation\-defined interval.

[`orient` 
Non\-standard](#orient)

Similar to the \-moz\-orient non\-standard CSS property impacting the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) elements, the `orient` attribute defines the orientation of the range slider. Values include `horizontal`, meaning the range is rendered horizontally, and `vertical`, where the range is rendered vertically. See [Creating vertical form controls](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_writing_modes/Vertical_controls) for a modern approach to creating vertical form controls.

[`results` 
Non\-standard](#results)

The `results` attribute—supported only by Safari—is a numeric value that lets you override the maximum number of entries to be displayed in the `` element's natively\-provided drop\-down menu of previous search queries.

The value must be a non\-negative decimal number. If not provided, or an invalid value is given, the browser's default maximum number of entries is used.

[`webkitdirectory` 
Non\-standard](#webkitdirectory)

The Boolean `webkitdirectory` attribute, if present, indicates that only directories should be available to be selected by the user in the file picker interface. See [`HTMLInputElement.webkitdirectory`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/webkitdirectory) for additional details and examples.

Though originally implemented only for WebKit\-based browsers, `webkitdirectory` is also usable in Microsoft Edge as well as Firefox 50 and later. However, even though it has relatively broad support, it is still not standard and should not be used unless you have no alternative.

## [Methods](#methods)

The following methods are provided by the [`HTMLInputElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) interface which represents `` elements in the DOM. Also available are those methods specified by the parent interfaces, [`HTMLElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement), [`Element`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), [`Node`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node), and [`EventTarget`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget).

[`checkValidity()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/checkValidity "checkValidity()")

Returns `true` if the element's value passes validity checks; otherwise, returns `false` and fires an [`invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/invalid_event "invalid") event at the element.

[`reportValidity()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/reportValidity "reportValidity()")

Returns `true` if the element's value passes validity checks; otherwise, returns `false`, fires an [`invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/invalid_event "invalid") event at the element, and (if the event isn't canceled) reports the problem to the user.

[`select()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/select "select()")

Selects the entire content of the `` element, if the element's content is selectable. For elements with no selectable text content (such as a visual color picker or calendar date input), this method does nothing.

[`setCustomValidity()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/setCustomValidity "setCustomValidity()")

Sets a custom message to display if the input element's value isn't valid.

[`setRangeText()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/setRangeText "setRangeText()")

Sets the contents of the specified range of characters in the input element to a given string. A `selectMode` parameter is available to allow controlling how the existing content is affected.

[`setSelectionRange()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/setSelectionRange "setSelectionRange()")

Selects the specified range of characters within a textual input element. Does nothing for inputs which aren't presented as text input fields.

[`showPicker()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/showPicker "showPicker()")

Displays the browser picker for the input element that would normally be displayed when the element is selected, but triggered from a button press or other user interaction.

[`stepDown()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/stepDown "stepDown()")

Decrements the value of a numeric input by one, by default, or by the specified number of units.

[`stepUp()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/stepUp "stepUp()")

Increments the value of a numeric input by one or by the specified number of units.

## [CSS](#css)

Inputs, being replaced elements, have a few features not applicable to non form elements. There are CSS selectors that can specifically target form controls based on their UI features, also known as UI pseudo\-classes. The input element can also be targeted by type with attribute selectors. There are some properties that are especially useful as well.

### [UI pseudo\-classes](#ui_pseudo-classes)

 Captions super relevant to the
 ``
 element:

| Pseudo\-class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`:enabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:enabled) | Any currently enabled element that can be activated (selected, clicked  on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus and also has a disabled state, in  which it can't be activated or accept focus. |
| [`:disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:disabled) | Any currently disabled element that has an enabled state, meaning it  otherwise could be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or  accept focus were it not disabled. |
| [`:read-only`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:read-only) | Element not editable by the user |
| [`:read-write`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:read-write) | Element that is editable by the user. |
| [`:placeholder-shown`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:placeholder-shown) | Element that is currently displaying [`placeholder` text](#placeholder),  including `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) elements with the [`placeholder`](#placeholder) attribute present that has, as yet, no value. |
| [`:default`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:default) | Form elements that are the default in a group of related elements.  Matches [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) and  [radio](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) input types that  were checked on page load or render. |
| [`:checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked) | Matches [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) and  [radio](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) input types that  are currently checked (and the ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) in a  [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) that is currently selected). |
| [`:indeterminate`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:indeterminate) | [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) elements  whose indeterminate property is set to true by JavaScript,  [radio](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) elements, when all  radio buttons with the same name value in the form are unchecked, and  [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress) elements in an indeterminate state |
| [`:valid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:valid) | Form controls that can have constraint validation applied and are  currently valid. |
| [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) | Form controls that have constraint validation applied and are currently  not valid. Matches a form control whose value doesn't match the  constraints set on it by its attributes, such as  [`required`](#required),  [`pattern`](#pattern),  [`step`](#step) and [`max`](#max). |
| [`:in-range`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:in-range) | A non\-empty input whose current value is within the range limits  specified by the [`min`](#min) and [`max`](#max) attributes and the [`step`](#step). |
| [`:out-of-range`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:out-of-range) | A non\-empty input whose current value is NOT within the range limits  specified by the [`min`](#min)  and [`max`](#max) attributes or  does not adhere to the [`step`](#step) constraint. |
| [`:required`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:required) | ``, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) element that has the [`required`](#required) attribute set on it.  Only matches elements that can be required.  The attribute included on a non\-requirable element will not make for a match. |
| [`:optional`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:optional) | ``, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select), or  [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) element that does NOT have the [`required`](#required) attribute set on it.  Does not match elements that can't be required. |
| [`:blank`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:blank) | `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) elements that currently have no value. |
| [`:user-invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:user-invalid) | Similar to `:invalid`, but is activated on blur. Matches  invalid input but only after the user interaction, such as by focusing  on the control, leaving the control, or attempting to submit the form  containing the invalid control. |

#### Pseudo\-classes example

We can style a checkbox label based on whether the checkbox is checked or not. In this example, we are styling the [`color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) and [`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) that comes immediately after a checked input. We haven't applied any styles if the `input` is not checked.

\`\`\`
\
\Toggle the checkbox on and off\

\`\`\`
css\`\`\`
input:checked \+ label {
 color: red;
 font\-weight: bold;
}

\`\`\`
### [Attribute selectors](#attribute_selectors)

It is possible to target different types of form controls based on their [`type`](#type) using [attribute selectors](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Attribute_selectors). CSS attribute selectors match elements based on either just the presence of an attribute or the value of a given attribute.

css\`\`\`
/\* matches a password input \*/
input\[type="password"] {
}

/\* matches a form control whose valid values are limited to a range of values\*/
input\[min]\[max] {
}

/\* matches a form control with a pattern attribute \*/
input\[pattern] {
}

\`\`\`### [::placeholder](#placeholder)

By default, the appearance of placeholder text is a translucent or light gray. The [`::placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::placeholder) pseudo\-element is the input's [`placeholder` text](#placeholder). It can be styled with a limited subset of CSS properties.

css\`\`\`
::placeholder {
 color: blue;
}

\`\`\`
Only the subset of CSS properties that apply to the [`::first-line`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::first-line) pseudo\-element can be used in a rule using `::placeholder` in its selector.

### [appearance](#appearance)

The [`appearance`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/appearance) property enables the displaying of (almost) any element as a platform\-native style based on the operating system's theme as well as the removal of any platform\-native styling with the `none` value.

You could make a `` look like a radio button with `div {appearance: radio;}` or a radio look like a checkbox with `[type="radio"] {appearance: checkbox;}`, but don't.

Setting `appearance: none` removes platform native borders, but not functionality.

### [caret\-color](#caret-color)

A property specific to text entry\-related elements is the CSS [`caret-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caret-color) property, which lets you set the color used to draw the text input caret:

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\Note the red caret:\
\

\`\`\`
#### CSS

css\`\`\`
input.custom {
 caret\-color: red;
 font:
 16px "Helvetica",
 "Arial",
 "sans\-serif";
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [field\-sizing](#field-sizing)

The [`field-sizing`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/field-sizing) property enables you to control the sizing behavior of form inputs (i.e. they are given a default preferred size by default.) This property enables you to override the default behavior, allowing form controls to adjust in size to fit their contents.

This property is typically used to create form fields that shrinkwrap their content and grow as more text is entered. This works with input types that accept direct text input (for example, [`text`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text) and [`url`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/url)), input type [`file`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) elements.

### [object\-position and object\-fit](#object-position_and_object-fit)

In certain cases (typically involving non\-textual inputs and specialized interfaces), the `` element is a [replaced element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element). When it is, the position and size of the element's size and positioning within its frame can be adjusted using the CSS [`object-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) and [`object-fit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) properties.

## [Additional features](#additional_features)

### [Labels](#labels)

Labels are needed to associate assistive text with an ``. The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element provides explanatory information about a form field that is *always* appropriate (aside from any layout concerns you have). It's never a bad idea to use a `` to explain what should be entered into an `` or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea).

#### Associated labels

The semantic pairing of `` and `` elements is useful for assistive technologies such as screen readers. By pairing them using the ``'s [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label#for) attribute, you bond the label to the input in a way that lets screen readers describe inputs to users more precisely.

It does not suffice to have plain text adjacent to the `` element. Rather, usability and accessibility requires the inclusion of either implicit or explicit [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label):

html\`\`\`
\
\Enter your name: \\

\
\
 \Enter your name: \\
\

\
\
 \Enter your name: \
 \
\

\`\`\`
The first example is inaccessible: no relationship exists between the prompt and the `` element.

In addition to an accessible name, the label provides a larger 'hit' area for mouse and touch screen users to click on or touch. By pairing a `` with an ``, clicking on either one will focus the ``. If you use plain text to "label" your input, this won't happen. Having the prompt part of the activation area for the input is helpful for people with motor control conditions.

As web developers, it's important that we never assume that people will know all the things that we know. The diversity of people using the web—and by extension your website—practically guarantees that some of your site's visitors will have some variation in thought processes and/or circumstances that leads them to interpret your forms very differently from you without clear and properly\-presented labels.

#### Placeholders are not accessible

The [`placeholder`](#placeholder) attribute lets you specify text that appears within the `` element's content area itself when it is empty. The placeholder should never be required to understand your forms. It is not a label, and should not be used as a substitute, because it isn't. The placeholder is used to provide a hint as to what an inputted value should look like, not an explanation or prompt.

Not only is the placeholder not accessible to screen readers, but once the user enters any text into the form control, or if the form control already has a value, the placeholder disappears. Browsers with automatic page translation features may skip over attributes when translating, meaning the `placeholder` may not get translated.

**Note:**
Don't use the [`placeholder`](#placeholder) attribute if you can avoid it. If you need to label an `` element, use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element.

### [Client\-side validation](#client-side_validation)

**Warning:**
Client\-side validation is useful, but it does *not* guarantee that the server will receive valid data. If the data must be in a specific format, *always* verify it also on the server\-side, and return a [`400` HTTP response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400) if the format is invalid.

In addition to using CSS to style inputs based on the [`:valid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:valid) or [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) UI states based on the current state of each input, as noted in the [UI pseudo\-classes](#ui_pseudo-classes) section above, the browser provides for client\-side validation on (attempted) form submission. On form submission, if there is a form control that fails constraint validation, supporting browsers will display an error message on the first invalid form control; displaying a default message based on the error type, or a message set by you.

Some input types and other attributes place limits on what values are valid for a given input. For example, `` means only the number 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 are valid. Several errors could occur, including a `rangeUnderflow` error if the value is less than 2, `rangeOverflow` if greater than 10, `stepMismatch` if the value is a number between 2 and 10, but not an even integer (does not match the requirements of the `step` attribute), or `typeMismatch` if the value is not a number.

For the input types whose domain of possible values is periodic (that is, at the highest possible value, the values wrap back around to the beginning rather than ending), it's possible for the values of the [`max`](#max) and [`min`](#min) properties to be reversed, which indicates that the range of permitted values starts at `min`, wraps around to the lowest possible value, then continues on until `max` is reached. This is particularly useful for dates and times, such as when you want to allow the range to be from 8 PM to 8 AM:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
Specific attributes and their values can lead to a specific error [`ValidityState`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState):

 Validity object errors depend on the ``
 attributes and their values:

| Attribute | Relevant property | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`max`](#max) | [`validityState.rangeOverflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/rangeOverflow) | Occurs when the value is greater than the maximum value as defined by  the `max` attribute |
| [`maxlength`](#maxlength) | [`validityState.tooLong`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooLong) | Occurs when the number of characters is greater than the number allowed by the `maxlength` property |
| [`min`](#min) | [`validityState.rangeUnderflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/rangeUnderflow) | Occurs when the value is less than the minimum value as defined by the `min` attribute |
| [`minlength`](#minlength) | [`validityState.tooShort`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooShort) | Occurs when the number of characters is less than the number required by the `minlength` property |
| [`pattern`](#pattern) | [`validityState.patternMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/patternMismatch) | Occurs when a pattern attribute is included with a valid regular expression and the `value` does not match it. |
| [`required`](#required) | [`validityState.valueMissing`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/valueMissing) | Occurs when the `required` attribute is present but the value is `null` or radio or checkbox is not checked. |
| [`step`](#step) | [`validityState.stepMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/stepMismatch) | The value doesn't match the step increment. Increment default is `1`, so only integers are valid on `type="number"`  is step is not included. `step="any"` will never throw this error. |
| [`type`](#type) | [`validityState.typeMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/typeMismatch) | Occurs when the value is not of the correct type, for example an email does not contain an `@` or a url doesn't contain a protocol. |

If a form control doesn't have the `required` attribute, no value, or an empty string, is not invalid. Even if the above attributes are present, with the exception of `required`, an empty string will not lead to an error.

We can set limits on what values we accept, and supporting browsers will natively validate these form values and alert the user if there is a mistake when the form is submitted.

In addition to the errors described in the table above, the `validityState` interface contains the `badInput`, `valid`, and `customError` boolean readonly properties. The validity object includes:

* [`validityState.valueMissing`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/valueMissing)
* [`validityState.typeMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/typeMismatch)
* [`validityState.patternMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/patternMismatch)
* [`validityState.tooLong`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooLong)
* [`validityState.tooShort`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/tooShort)
* [`validityState.rangeUnderflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/rangeUnderflow)
* [`validityState.rangeOverflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/rangeOverflow)
* [`validityState.stepMismatch`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/stepMismatch)
* [`validityState.badInput`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/badInput)
* [`validityState.valid`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState "validityState.valid")
* [`validityState.customError`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState "validityState.customError")

For each of these Boolean properties, a value of `true` indicates that the specified reason validation may have failed is true, with the exception of the `valid` property, which is `true` if the element's value obeys all constraints.

If there is an error, supporting browsers will both alert the user and prevent the form from being submitted. A word of caution: if a custom error is set to a truthy value (anything other than the empty string or `null`), the form will be prevented from being submitted. If there is no custom error message, and none of the other properties return true, `valid` will be true, and the form can be submitted.

js\`\`\`
function validate(input) {
 let validityState\_object = input.validity;
 if (validityState\_object.valueMissing) {
 input.setCustomValidity("A value is required");
 } else if (validityState\_object.rangeUnderflow) {
 input.setCustomValidity("Your value is too low");
 } else if (validityState\_object.rangeOverflow) {
 input.setCustomValidity("Your value is too high");
 } else {
 input.setCustomValidity("");
 }
}

\`\`\`
The last line, setting the custom validity message to the empty string is vital. If the user makes an error, and the validity is set, it will fail to submit, even if all the values are valid, until the message is `null`.

#### Custom validation error example

If you want to present a custom error message when a field fails to validate, you need to use the [Constraint Validation API](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation#validating_forms_using_javascript) available on `` (and related) elements. Take the following form:

html\`\`\`
\
 \Enter username (upper and lowercase letters): \
 \
 \Submit\
\

\`\`\`
The basic HTML form validation features will cause this to produce a default error message if you try to submit the form with either no valid filled in, or a value that does not match the `pattern`.

If you wanted to instead display custom error messages, you could use JavaScript like the following:

js\`\`\`
const nameInput = document.querySelector("input");

nameInput.addEventListener("input", () =\> {
 nameInput.setCustomValidity("");
 nameInput.checkValidity();
});

nameInput.addEventListener("invalid", () =\> {
 if (nameInput.value === "") {
 nameInput.setCustomValidity("Enter your username!");
 } else {
 nameInput.setCustomValidity(
 "Usernames can only contain upper and lowercase letters. Try again!",
 );
 }
});

\`\`\`
The example renders like so:

In brief:

* We check the valid state of the input element every time its value is changed by running the `checkValidity()` method via the `input` event handler.
* If the value is invalid, an `invalid` event is raised, and the `invalid` event handler function is run. Inside this function we work out whether the value is invalid because it is empty, or because it doesn't match the pattern, using an `if ()` block, and set a custom validity error message.
* As a result, if the input value is invalid when the submit button is pressed, one of the custom error messages will be shown.
* If it is valid, it will submit as you'd expect. For this to happen, the custom validity has to be cancelled, by invoking `setCustomValidity()` with an empty string value. We therefore do this every time the `input` event is raised. If you don't do this, and a custom validity was previously set, the input will register as invalid, even if it currently contains a valid value on submission.

**Note:**
Always validate input constraints both client side and server side. Constraint validation doesn't remove the need for validation on the *server side*. Invalid values can still be sent by older browsers or by bad actors.

**Note:**
Firefox supported a proprietary error attribute — `x-moz-errormessage` — for many versions, which allowed you set custom error messages in a similar way. This has been removed as of version 66 (see [Firefox bug 1513890](https://bugzil.la/1513890)).

### [Localization](#localization)

The allowed inputs for certain `` types depend on the locale. In some locales, 1,000\.00 is a valid number, while in other locales the valid way to enter this number is 1\.000,00\.

Firefox uses the following heuristics to determine the locale to validate the user's input (at least for `type="number"`):

* Try the language specified by a `lang`/`xml:lang` attribute on the element or any of its parents.
* Try the language specified by any `Content-Language` HTTP header. Or,
* If none specified, use the browser's locale.
## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Labels](#labels_2)

When including inputs, it is an accessibility requirement to add labels alongside. This is needed so those who use assistive technologies can tell what the input is for. Also, clicking or touching a label gives focus to the label's associated form control. This improves the accessibility and usability for sighted users, increases the area a user can click or touch to activate the form control. This is especially useful (and even needed) for radio buttons and checkboxes, which are tiny. For more information about labels in general see [Labels](#labels).

The following is an example of how to associate the `` with an `` element in the above style. You need to give the `` an `id` attribute. The `` then needs a `for` attribute whose value is the same as the input's `id`.

html\`\`\`
\Do you like peas?\
\

\`\`\`### [Size](#size)

Interactive elements such as form input should provide an area large enough that it is easy to activate them.

## <ins>: The Inserted Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del) element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`cite`](#cite)

This attribute defines the URI of a resource that explains the change, such as a link to meeting minutes or a ticket in a troubleshooting system.

[`datetime`](#datetime)

This attribute indicates the time and date of the change and must be a valid date with an optional time string. If the value cannot be parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not have an associated timestamp. For the format of the string without a time, see [Format of a valid date string](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#date_strings). The format of the string if it includes both date and time is covered in [Format of a valid local date and time string](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#local_date_and_time_strings).

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The presence of the `` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property, along with the [`::before`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and [`::after`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo\-elements.

css\`\`\`
ins::before,
ins::after {
 clip\-path: inset(100%);
 clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
 height: 1px;
 overflow: hidden;
 position: absolute;
 white\-space: nowrap;
 width: 1px;
}

ins::before {
 content: " \[insertion start] ";
}

ins::after {
 content: " \[insertion end] ";
}

\`\`\`
Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not knowing content has been inserted would adversely affect understanding.

## <kbd>: The Keyboard Input element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) defaults to rendering the contents of a `` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.

## [Try it](#try_it)

`` may be nested in various combinations with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp) (Sample Output) element to represent various forms of input or output based on visual cues.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

Other elements can be used in tandem with `` to represent more specific scenarios:

* Nesting a `` element within another `` element represents an actual key or other unit of input as a portion of a larger input. See [Representing keystrokes within an input](#representing_keystrokes_within_an_input) below.
* Nesting a `` element inside a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp) element represents input that has been echoed back to the user by the system. See [Echoed input](#echoed_input), below, for an example.
* Nesting a `` element inside a `` element, on the other hand, represents input which is based on text presented by the system, such as the names of menus and menu items, or the names of buttons displayed on the screen. See the example under [Representing onscreen input options](#representing_onscreen_input_options) below.

**Note:**
You can define a custom style to override the browser's default font selection for the `` element, although the user's preferences may potentially override your CSS.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic example](#basic_example)

html\`\`\`
\
 Use the command \help my\-command\ to view documentation for the
 command "my\-command".
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Representing keystrokes within an input](#representing_keystrokes_within_an_input)

To describe an input comprised of multiple keystrokes, you can nest multiple `` elements, with an outer `` element representing the overall input and each individual keystroke or component of the input enclosed within its own ``.

#### Unstyled

First, let's look at what this looks like as just plain HTML.

##### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 You can also create a new document using the
 \\Ctrl\\+\N\\ keyboard shortcut.
\

\`\`\`
This wraps the entire key sequence in an outer `` element, then each individual key within its own, in order to denote the components of the sequence.

**Note:**
You don't need to do all this wrapping; you can choose to simplify it by leaving out the external `` element. In other words, simplifying this to just `Ctrl+N` would be perfectly valid.

Depending on your style sheet, though, you may find it useful to do this kind of nesting.

##### Result

The output looks like this without a style sheet applied:

#### With custom styles

We can make more sense of this by adding some CSS:

##### CSS

We add a new selector for nested `` elements, `kbd>kbd`, which we can apply when rendering keyboard keys:

css\`\`\`
kbd \> kbd {
 border\-radius: 3px;
 padding: 1px 2px 0;
 border: 1px solid black;
}

\`\`\`
##### HTML

Then we update the HTML to use this class on the keys in the output to be presented:

html\`\`\`
\
 You can also create a new document by pressing the
 \\Ctrl\\+\N\\ shortcut.
\

\`\`\`
##### Result

The result is just what we want!

### [Echoed input](#echoed_input)

Nesting a `` element inside a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp) element represents input that has been echoed back to the user by the system.

html\`\`\`
\
 If a syntax error occurs, the tool will output the initial command you typed
 for your review:
\
\
 \\custom\-git ad my\-new\-file.cpp\\
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Representing onscreen input options](#representing_onscreen_input_options)

Nesting a `` element inside a `` element represents input which is based on text presented by the system, such as the names of menus and menu items, or the names of buttons displayed on the screen.

For example, you can explain how to choose the "New Document" option in the "File" menu using HTML that looks like this:

html\`\`\`
\
 To create a new file, choose the \\\File\\
 ⇒\\New Document\\\ menu option.
\

\
 Don't forget to click the \\OK\\ button to confirm once
 you've entered the name of the new file.
\

\`\`\`
This does some interesting nesting. For the menu option description, the entire input is enclosed in a `` element. Then, inside that, both the menu and menu item names are contained within both `` and ``, indicating an input which is selected from a screen widget.

#### Result

## <label>: The Label element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.

## [Try it](#try_it)

Associating a `` with a form control, such as [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) offers some major advantages:

* The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it too. This means that, for example, a screen reader will read out the label when the user is focused on the form input, making it easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.
* When a user clicks or touches/taps a label, the browser passes the focus to its associated input (the resulting event is also raised for the input). That increased hit area for focusing the input provides an advantage to anyone trying to activate it — including those using a touch\-screen device.

To explicitly associate a `` element with an `` element, you first need to add the `id` attribute to the `` element. Next, you add the `for` attribute to the `` element, where the value of `for` is the same as the `id` in the `` element.

Alternatively, you can nest the `` directly inside the ``, in which case the `for` and `id` attributes are not needed because the association is implicit:

html\`\`\`
\
 Do you like peas?
 \
\

\`\`\`
The form control that a label is labeling is called the *labeled control* of the label element. Multiple labels can be associated with the same form control:

html\`\`\`
\Enter your username:\
\
\Forgot your username?\

\`\`\`
Elements that can be associated with a `` element include [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) (except for `type="hidden"`), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea).

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/for)

The value of the `for` attribute must be a single [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) for a [labelable](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories#labelable) form\-related element in the same document as the `` element. So, any given `label` element can be associated with only one form control.

**Note:**
To programmatically set the `for` attribute, use [`htmlFor`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor).

The first element in the document with an `id` attribute matching the value of the `for` attribute is the *labeled control* for this `label` element — if the element with that `id` is actually a [labelable element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#category-label). If it is *not* a labelable element, then the `for` attribute has no effect. If there are other elements that also match the `id` value, later in the document, they are not considered.

Multiple `label` elements can be given the same value for their `for` attribute; doing so causes the associated form control (the form control that `for` value references) to have multiple labels.

**Note:**
A `` element can have both a `for` attribute and a contained control element, as long as the `for` attribute points to the contained control element.

## [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

There are no special styling considerations for `` elements — structurally they are simple inline elements, and so can be styled in much the same way as a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) element. You can apply styling to them in any way you want, as long as you don't cause the text to become difficult to read.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Interactive content](#interactive_content)

Don't place interactive elements such as [anchors](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) or [buttons](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) inside a `label`. Doing so makes it difficult for people to activate the form input associated with the `label`.

**Don't do this:**

 \
 I agree to the \Terms and Conditions\
\

\`\`\`
**Prefer this:**

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 I agree to the Terms and Conditions
\
\
 \Read our Terms and Conditions\
\

\`\`\`### [Headings](#headings)

Placing [heading elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) within a `` interferes with many kinds of assistive technology, because headings are commonly used as [a navigation aid](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#navigation). If the label's text needs to be adjusted visually, use CSS classes applied to the `` element instead.

If a [form](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), or a section of a form needs a title, use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend) element placed within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset).

**Don't do this:**

html\`\`\`
\
 \Your name\
 \
\

\`\`\`
**Prefer this:**

html\`\`\`
\
 Your name
 \
\

\`\`\`### [Buttons](#buttons)

An [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element with a `type="button"` declaration and a valid `value` attribute does not need a label associated with it. Doing so may actually interfere with how assistive technology parses the button input. The same applies for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) element.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Defining an implicit label](#defining_an_implicit_label)

html\`\`\`

The only allowed value for this attribute is a number, even if the list is displayed with Roman numerals or letters. List items that follow this one continue numbering from the value set. This attribute has no meaning for unordered lists ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)) or for menus ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu)).

[`type` 
Deprecated](#type)

This character attribute indicates the numbering type:

* `a`: lowercase letters
* `A`: uppercase letters
* `i`: lowercase Roman numerals
* `I`: uppercase Roman numerals
* `1`: numbers

This type overrides the one used by its parent [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) element, if any.

**Note:**
This attribute has been deprecated; use the CSS [`list-style-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) property instead.

## <link>: The External Resource Link element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.
This element is most commonly used to link to [stylesheets](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS), but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.

## [Try it](#try_it)

To link an external stylesheet, you'd include a `` element inside your [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) like this:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
This example provides the path to the stylesheet inside an `href` attribute and a [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel) attribute with a value of `stylesheet`. The `rel` stands for "relationship", and is one of the key features of the `` element — the value denotes how the item being linked to is related to the containing document.

There are a number of other common types you'll come across. For example, a link to the site's favicon:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
There are a number of other icon `rel` values, mainly used to indicate special icon types for use on various mobile platforms, e.g.:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
The `sizes` attribute indicates the icon size, while the `type` contains the MIME type of the resource being linked.
These provide useful hints to allow the browser to choose the most appropriate icon available.

You can also provide a media type or query inside a `media` attribute; this resource will then only be loaded if the media condition is true. For example:

html\`\`\`
\
\

\`\`\`
Some interesting new performance and security features have been added to the `` element too. Take this example:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
A `rel` value of `preload` indicates that the browser should preload this resource (see [`rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload) for more details), with the `as` attribute indicating the specific class of content being fetched.
The `crossorigin` attribute indicates whether the resource should be fetched with a [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) request.

Other usage notes:

* A `` element can occur either in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) element, depending on whether it has a [link type](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#body-ok) that is **body\-ok**.
For example, the `stylesheet` link type is body\-ok, and therefore `` is permitted in the body.
However, this isn't a good practice to follow; it makes more sense to separate your `` elements from your body content, putting them in the ``.
* When using `` to establish a favicon for a site, and your site uses a Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance its security, the policy applies to the favicon.
If you encounter problems with the favicon not loading, verify that the [`Content-Security-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) header's [`img-src` directive](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/img-src) is not preventing access to it.
* The HTML and XHTML specifications define event handlers for the `` element, but it is unclear how they would be used.
* Under XHTML 1\.0, [void elements](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element) such as `` require a trailing slash: ``.
* WebTV supports the use of the value `next` for `rel` to preload the next page in a document series.
## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`as`](#as)

This attribute is required when [`rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload) has been set on the `` element, optional when [`rel="modulepreload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/modulepreload) has been set, and otherwise should not be used.
It specifies the type of content being loaded by the ``, which is necessary for request matching, application of correct [content security policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), and setting of correct [`Accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) request header.

Furthermore, `rel="preload"` uses this as a signal for request prioritization.
The table below lists the valid values for this attribute and the elements or resources they apply to.

| Value | Applies To |
| --- | --- |
| audio | `` elements |
| document | `` and `` elements |
| embed | `` elements |
| fetch | fetch, XHR   **Note:** This value also requires  `` to contain the crossorigin attribute, see [CORS\-enabled fetches](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload#cors-enabled_fetches). |
| font | CSS @font\-face   **Note:** This value also requires  `` to contain the crossorigin attribute, see [CORS\-enabled fetches](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload#cors-enabled_fetches). |
| image | `` and `` elements with  srcset or imageset attributes, SVG `` elements,  CSS `*-image` rules |
| object | `` elements |
| script | `` elements, Worker `importScripts` |
| style | `` elements, CSS  `@import` |
| track | `` elements |
| video | `` elements |
| worker | Worker, SharedWorker |

[`blocking`](#blocking)

This attribute explicitly indicates that certain operations should be blocked on the fetching of an external resource. It must only be used when the `rel` attribute contains `expect` or `stylesheet` keywords. The operations that are to be blocked must be a space\-separated list of blocking tokens listed below.

* `render`: The rendering of content on the screen is blocked.

[`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin)

This [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) attribute indicates whether [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) must be used when fetching the resource.
[CORS\-enabled images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image) can be reused in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element without being *tainted*.
The allowed values are:

[`anonymous`](#anonymous)

A cross\-origin request (i.e. with an [`Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) HTTP header) is performed, but no credential is sent (i.e. no cookie, X.509 certificate, or HTTP Basic authentication).
If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) HTTP header) the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted.

[`use-credentials`](#use-credentials)

A cross\-origin request (i.e. with an `Origin` HTTP header) is performed along with a credential sent (i.e. a cookie, certificate, and/or HTTP Basic authentication is performed).
If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through [`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) HTTP header), the resource will be *tainted* and its usage restricted.

If the attribute is not present, the resource is fetched without a [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) request (i.e. without sending the `Origin` HTTP header), preventing its non\-tainted usage. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword **anonymous** was used.
See [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) for additional information.

[`disabled`](#disabled)

For `rel="stylesheet"` only, the `disabled` Boolean attribute indicates whether the described stylesheet should be loaded and applied to the document.
If `disabled` is specified in the HTML when it is loaded, the stylesheet will not be loaded during page load.
Instead, the stylesheet will be loaded on\-demand, if and when the `disabled` attribute is changed to `false` or removed.

Setting the `disabled` property in the DOM causes the stylesheet to be removed from the document's [`Document.styleSheets`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/styleSheets) list.

[`fetchpriority`](#fetchpriority)

Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching a resource of a particular type.
Allowed values:

[`high`](#high)

Fetch the resource at a high priority relative to other resources of the same type.

[`low`](#low)

Fetch the resource at a low priority relative to other resources of the same type.

[`auto`](#auto)

Don't set a preference for the fetch priority.
This is the default.
It is used if no value or an invalid value is set.

See [`HTMLLinkElement.fetchPriority`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLinkElement/fetchPriority) for more information.

[`href`](#href)

This attribute specifies the [URL](/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL) of the linked resource. A URL can be absolute or relative.

[`hreflang`](#hreflang)

This attribute indicates the language of the linked resource.
It is purely advisory.
Allowed values are specified by [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47\)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).
Use this attribute only if the [`href`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#href) attribute is present.

[`imagesizes`](#imagesizes)

For `rel="preload"` and `as="image"` only, the `imagesizes` attribute has similar syntax and semantics as the [`sizes`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes) attribute that indicates to preload the appropriate resource used by an `img` element with corresponding values for its `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

[`imagesrcset`](#imagesrcset)

For `rel="preload"` and `as="image"` only, the `imagesrcset` attribute has similar syntax and semantics as the [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset) attribute that indicates to preload the appropriate resource used by an `img` element with corresponding values for its `srcset` and `sizes` attributes.

[`integrity`](#integrity)

Contains inline metadata — a base64\-encoded cryptographic hash of the resource (file) you're telling the browser to fetch.
The browser can use this to verify that the fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation.
The attribute must only be specified when the `rel` attribute is specified to `stylesheet`, `preload`, or `modulepreload`.
See [Subresource Integrity](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).

[`media`](#media)

This attribute specifies the media that the linked resource applies to. Its value must be a media type / [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries).
This attribute is mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets — it allows the user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on.

[`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy)

A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource:

* `no-referrer` means that the [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent.
* `no-referrer-when-downgrade` means that no [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will be sent when navigating to an origin without TLS (HTTPS).
This is a user agent's default behavior, if no policy is otherwise specified.
* `origin` means that the referrer will be the origin of the page, which is roughly the scheme, the host, and the port.
* `origin-when-cross-origin` means that navigating to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port, while navigating on the same origin will include the referrer's path.
* `unsafe-url` means that the referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username).
This case is unsafe because it can leak origins and paths from TLS\-protected resources to insecure origins.

[`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel)

This attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the current document. The attribute must be a space\-separated list of [link type values](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel).

[`sizes`](#sizes)

This attribute defines the sizes of the icons for visual media contained in the resource.
It must be present only if the [`rel`](#rel) contains a value of `icon` or a non\-standard type such as Apple's `apple-touch-icon`.
It may have the following values:

* `any`, meaning that the icon can be scaled to any size as it is in a vector format, like `image/svg+xml`.
* a white\-space separated list of sizes, each in the format `x` or `X`. Each of these sizes must be contained in the resource.

**Note:**
Most icon formats are only able to store one single icon; therefore, most of the time, the [`sizes`](#sizes) attribute contains only one entry.
Microsoft's ICO format and Apple's ICNS format can store multiple icon sizes in a single file. ICO has better browser support, so you should use this format if cross\-browser support is a concern.

[`title`](#title)

The `title` attribute has special semantics on the `` element.
When used on a `` it defines a [default or an alternate stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets).

[`type`](#type)

This attribute is used to define the type of the content linked to.
The value of the attribute should be a MIME type such as **text/html**, **text/css**, and so on.
The common use of this attribute is to define the type of stylesheet being referenced (such as **text/css**), but given that CSS is the only stylesheet language used on the web, not only is it possible to omit the `type` attribute, but is actually now recommended practice.
It is also used on `rel="preload"` link types, to make sure the browser only downloads file types that it supports.

### [Non\-standard attributes](#non-standard_attributes)

[`target` 
Deprecated](#target)

Defines the frame or window name that has the defined linking relationship or that will show the rendering of any linked resource.

### [Obsolete attributes](#obsolete_attributes)

[`charset` 
Deprecated](#charset)

This attribute defines the character encoding of the linked resource.
The value is a space\- and/or comma\-delimited list of character sets as defined in [RFC 2045](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045).
The default value is `iso-8859-1`.

**Note:**
To produce the same effect as this obsolete attribute, use the [`Content-Type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) HTTP header on the linked resource.

[`rev` 
Deprecated](#rev)

The value of this attribute shows the relationship of the current document to the linked document, as defined by the [`href`](#href) attribute.
The attribute thus defines the reverse relationship compared to the value of the `rel` attribute.
[Link type values](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel) for the attribute are similar to the possible values for [`rel`](#rel).

**Note:**
Instead of `rev`, you should use the [`rel`](#rel) attribute with the opposite [link type value](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel).
For example, to establish the reverse link for `made`, specify `author`. Also, this attribute doesn't stand for "revision" and must not be used with a version number, even though many sites misuse it in this way.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Including a stylesheet](#including_a_stylesheet)

To include a stylesheet in a page, use the following syntax:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`### [Providing alternative stylesheets](#providing_alternative_stylesheets)

You can also specify [alternative style sheets](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets).

The user can choose which style sheet to use by choosing it from the **View \> Page Style** menu.
This provides a way for users to see multiple versions of a page.

html\`\`\`
\
\
\

\`\`\`### [Providing icons for different usage contexts](#providing_icons_for_different_usage_contexts)

You can include links to several icons on the same page, and the browser will choose which one works best for its particular context using the `rel` and `sizes` values as hints.

html\`\`\`
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

\`\`\`
For information about what `sizes` to choose for Apple icons, see [Apple's documentation on configuring web applications](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW4) and the referenced [Apple human interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#App-icon-sizes). Usually, it is sufficient to provide a large image, such as 192x192, and let the browser scale it down as needed, but you may want to provide images with different levels of detail for different sizes, as the Apple design guideline recommends. Providing smaller icons for lower resolutions also saves bandwidth.

It may not be necessary to provide `` elements at all. For example, browsers automatically request `/favicon.ico` from the root of a site, and Apple also automatically requests `/apple-touch-icon-[size].png`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`, etc. However, providing explicit links protects you against changes to these conventions.

### [Conditionally loading resources with media queries](#conditionally_loading_resources_with_media_queries)

You can provide a media type or query inside a `media` attribute;
this resource will then only be loaded if the media condition is true. For example:

html\`\`\`
\
\
\
\

\`\`\`### [Stylesheet load events](#stylesheet_load_events)

You can determine when a style sheet has been loaded by watching for a `load` event to fire on it; similarly, you can detect if an error has occurred while processing a style sheet by watching for an `error` event:

html\`\`\`
\

\
 const stylesheet = document.getElementById("my\-stylesheet");

 stylesheet.onload = () =\> {
 // Do something interesting; the sheet has been loaded
 };

 stylesheet.onerror = () =\> {
 console.log("An error occurred loading the stylesheet!");
 };
\

\`\`\`

**Note:**
The `load` event fires once the stylesheet and all of its imported content has been loaded and parsed, and immediately before the styles start being applied to the content.

### [Preload examples](#preload_examples)

You can find a number of `` examples in [Preloading content with `rel="preload"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload).

### [Blocking rendering till a resource is fetched](#blocking_rendering_till_a_resource_is_fetched)

You can include `render` token inside a `blocking` attribute;
the rendering of the page will be blocked till the resource is fetched. For example:

html\`\`\`
\

## <main>: The Main element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the dominant content of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body) of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

## [Try it](#try_it)

A document mustn't have more than one `` element that doesn't have the [`hidden`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden) attribute specified.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The content of a `` element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the main function of the page.

`` doesn't contribute to the document's outline; that is, unlike elements such as [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body), headings such as [h2](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements), and such, `` doesn't affect the [DOM's](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM) concept of the structure of the page. It's strictly informative.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Landmark](#landmark)

The `` element behaves like a [`main` landmark](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/main_role) role. [Landmarks](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#landmark_roles) can be used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large sections of the document. Prefer using the `` element over declaring `role="main"`, unless there are [legacy browser support concerns](#browser_compatibility).

### [Skip navigation](#skip_navigation)

Skip navigation, also known as "skipnav", is a technique that allows an assistive technology user to quickly bypass large sections of repeated content (main navigation, info banners, etc.). This lets the user access the main content of the page faster.

Adding an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute to the `` element lets it be a target of a skip navigation link.

\
 \Skip to main content\

## <map>: The Image Map element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used with [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`name`](#name)

The `name` attribute gives the map a name so that it can be referenced. The attribute must be present and must have a non\-empty value with no space characters. The value of the `name` attribute must not be equal to the value of the `name` attribute of another `` element in the same document. If the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute is also specified, both attributes must have the same value.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Image map with two areas](#image_map_with_two_areas)

## <mark>: The Mark Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents text which is **marked** or **highlighted** for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

Typical use cases for `` include:

* When used in a quotation ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q)) or block quote ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote)), it generally indicates text which is of special interest but is not marked in the original source material, or material which needs special scrutiny even though the original author didn't think it was of particular importance. Think of this like using a highlighter pen in a book to mark passages that you find of interest.
* Otherwise, `` indicates a portion of the document's content which is likely to be relevant to the user's current activity. This might be used, for example, to indicate the words that matched a search operation.
* Don't use `` for syntax highlighting purposes; instead, use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element with appropriate CSS applied to it.

**Note:**
Don't confuse `` with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) element; `` is used to denote content which has a degree of *relevance*, while `` indicates spans of text of *importance*.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The presence of the `mark` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property, along with the [`::before`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and [`::after`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo\-elements.

css\`\`\`
mark::before,
mark::after {
 clip\-path: inset(100%);
 clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
 height: 1px;
 overflow: hidden;
 position: absolute;
 white\-space: nowrap;
 width: 1px;
}

mark::before {
 content: " \[highlight start] ";
}

mark::after {
 content: " \[highlight end] ";
}

\`\`\`
Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not knowing content has been highlighted would adversely affect understanding.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Marking text of interest](#marking_text_of_interest)

In this first example, a `` element is used to mark some text within a quote which is of particular interest to the user.

html\`\`\`
\
 It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base,
 have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the
 battle, \Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans\ to the Empire's
 ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to
 destroy an entire planet.

### [Identifying context\-sensitive passages](#identifying_context-sensitive_passages)

This example demonstrates using `` to mark search results within a passage.

html\`\`\`
\
 It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been
 destroyed, \Imperial\ troops have driven the Rebel
 forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy.
\

\
 Evading the dreaded \Imperial\ Starfleet, a group of
 freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new secret base on
 the remote ice world of Hoth.
\

\`\`\`
To help distinguish the use of `` for search results from other potential usage, this example applies the custom class `"match"` to each match.

## <marquee>: The Marquee element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes.

The HTML `` element is deprecated and its use is strongly discouraged. If you must create the effect of scrolling text or continuous elements, consider using [CSS animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations) with [CSS transforms](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transforms/Using_CSS_transforms) instead of `` elements to smoothly animate content. Additionally, include the [`prefers-reduced-motion`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) CSS [`@media`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media) query to stop the animation based on user preference, thereby improving user experience and accessibility.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

[`behavior` 
Deprecated](#behavior)

Sets how the text is scrolled within the marquee. Possible values are `scroll`, `slide` and `alternate`. If no value is specified, the default value is `scroll`.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Sets the background color through color name or hexadecimal value.

[`direction` 
Deprecated](#direction)

Sets the direction of the scrolling within the marquee. Possible values are `left`, `right`, `up` and `down`. If no value is specified, the default value is `left`.

[`height` 
Deprecated](#height)

Sets the height in pixels or percentage value.

[`hspace` 
Deprecated](#hspace)

Sets the horizontal margin

[`loop` 
Deprecated](#loop)

Sets the number of times the marquee will scroll. If no value is specified, the default value is −1, which means the marquee will scroll continuously.

[`scrollamount` 
Deprecated](#scrollamount)

Sets the amount of scrolling at each interval in pixels. The default value is 6\.

[`scrolldelay` 
Deprecated](#scrolldelay)

Sets the interval between each scroll movement in milliseconds. The default value is 85\. Note that any value smaller than 60 is ignored and the value 60 is used instead unless `truespeed` is specified.

[`truespeed` 
Deprecated](#truespeed)

By default, `scrolldelay` values lower than 60 are ignored. If `truespeed` is present, those values are not ignored.

[`vspace` 
Deprecated](#vspace)

Sets the vertical margin in pixels or percentage value.

[`width` 
Deprecated](#width)

Sets the width in pixels or percentage value.

## [Examples](#examples)

## <menu>: The Menu element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is described in the HTML specification as a semantic alternative to [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul), but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul). It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li) elements).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) elements both represent an unordered list of items. The key difference is that [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) primarily contains items for display, while `` was intended for interactive items.

**Note:**
In early versions of the HTML specification, the `` element had an additional use case as a context menu. This functionality is considered obsolete and is not in the specification.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Toolbar](#toolbar)

In this example, a `` is used to create a toolbar for an editing application.

## <meta>: The metadata element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents [metadata](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Metadata) that cannot be represented by other HTML meta\-related elements, like [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title).

The type of metadata provided by the `` element can be one of the following:

* If the [`name`](#name) attribute is set, the `` element provides *document\-level metadata*, applying to the whole page.
* If the [`http-equiv`](#http-equiv) attribute is set, the `` element is a *pragma directive*, providing information equivalent to what can be given by a similarly\-named HTTP header.
* If the [`charset`](#charset) attribute is set, the `` element is a *charset declaration*, giving the character encoding in which the document is encoded.
* If the [`itemprop`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop) attribute is set, the `` element provides *user\-defined metadata*.
## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

**Note:**
The attribute [`name`](#name) has a specific meaning for the `` element, and the [`itemprop`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/itemprop) attribute must not be set on the same `` element that has any existing [`name`](#name), [`http-equiv`](#http-equiv) or [`charset`](#charset) attributes.

[`charset`](#charset)

This attribute declares the document's character encoding. If the attribute is present, its value must be an ASCII case\-insensitive match for the string `"utf-8"`, because UTF\-8 is the only valid encoding for HTML5 documents. `` elements which declare a character encoding must be located entirely within the first 1024 bytes of the document.

[`content`](#content)

This attribute contains the value for the [`http-equiv`](#http-equiv) or [`name`](#name) attribute, depending on which is used.

[`http-equiv`](#http-equiv)

Defines a pragma directive. The attribute's name, short for `http-equivalent`, is because all the allowed values are names of particular HTTP headers:

[`content-security-policy`](#content-security-policy)

Allows page authors to define a [content policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) for the current page. Content policies mostly specify allowed server origins and script endpoints which help guard against cross\-site scripting attacks.

Also see [`Content-Security-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy).

[`content-type`](#content-type)

Declares the [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types) and the document's character encoding. The `content` attribute must have the value `"text/html; charset=utf-8"` if specified. This is equivalent to a `` element with the [`charset`](#charset) attribute specified and carries the same restriction on placement within the document. **Note:** Can only be used in documents served with a `text/html` — not in documents served with an XML MIME type.

Also see [`Content-Type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type).

[`default-style`](#default-style)

Sets the name of the default [CSS style sheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) set.

[`x-ua-compatible`](#x-ua-compatible)

If specified, the `content` attribute must have the value `"IE=edge"`. User agents are required to ignore this pragma.

[`refresh`](#refresh)

This instruction specifies:

* The number of seconds until the page should be reloaded \- if the [`content`](#content) attribute's value is a non\-negative integer.
* The number of seconds until the page should redirect to another \- if the [`content`](#content) attribute's value is a non\-negative integer followed by `;url=` and a valid URL.

The timer starts when the page is *completely loaded*, which is after the [`load`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event "load") and [`pageshow`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pageshow_event "pageshow") events have both fired.

Also see [`Refresh`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Refresh).

**Warning:**

Pages set with a `refresh` value run the risk of having the time interval being too short. People navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader may be unable to read through and understand the page's content before being automatically redirected. The abrupt, unannounced updating of the page content may also be disorienting for people experiencing low vision conditions.

[`media`](#media)

The `media` attribute defines which media the theme color defined in the `content` attribute should be applied to. Its value is a [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries), which defaults to `all` if the attribute is missing. This attribute is only relevant when the element's [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name) attribute is set to [`theme-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color). Otherwise, it has no effect, and should not be included.

[`name`](#name)

The `name` and `content` attributes can be used together to provide document metadata in terms of name\-value pairs, with the `name` attribute giving the metadata name, and the `content` attribute giving the value.

See [standard metadata names](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name) for details about the set of standard metadata names defined in the HTML specification.

## Standard metadata names - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name)

The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) element can be used to provide document metadata in terms of name\-value pairs, with the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#name) attribute giving the metadata name, and the [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#content) attribute giving the value.

### [Standard metadata names defined in the HTML specification](#standard_metadata_names_defined_in_the_html_specification)

The HTML specification defines the following set of standard metadata names:

* `application-name`: the name of the application running in the web page.

**Note:**

	+ Browsers may use this to identify the application. It is different from the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title) element, which usually contain the application name, but may also contain information like the document name or a status.
	+ Simple web pages shouldn't define an application\-name.
* `author`: the name of the document's author.
* `description`: a short and accurate summary of the content of the page. Search engines like [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#meta-descriptions) may use this field to control the appearance of the webpage in the search result.
* `generator`: the identifier of the software that generated the page.
* `keywords`: words relevant to the page's content separated by commas.
* `referrer`: controls the HTTP [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header of requests sent from the document:

 Values for the
 `content`
 attribute of
 ``

| `no-referrer` | Do not send a HTTP [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header. |
| --- | --- |
| `origin` | Send the [origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin) of the document. |
| `no-referrer-when-downgrade` | Send the full URL when the destination is at least as secure as the  current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but send no referrer when it's less secure  (HTTPS→HTTP). This is the default behavior. |
| `origin-when-cross-origin` | Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same\-origin requests, but  only send the origin for other cases. |
| `same-origin` | Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same\-origin requests.  Cross\-origin requests will contain no referrer header. |
| `strict-origin` | Send the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the  current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but send no referrer when it's less secure  (HTTPS→HTTP). |
| `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same\-origin requests.  Send the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the  current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS). Otherwise, send no referrer. |
| `unsafe-URL` | Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same\-origin or  cross\-origin requests. |

**Note:**

	+ Dynamically inserting `` (with [`document.write()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write "document.write()") or [`appendChild()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild "appendChild()")) makes the referrer behavior unpredictable.
	+ When several conflicting policies are defined, the `no-referrer` policy is applied.
* [`theme-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color): indicates a suggested color that user agents should use to customize the display of the page or of the surrounding user interface. The `content` attribute contains a valid CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). The `media` attribute with a valid media query list can be included to set the media the theme color metadata applies to.
* [`color-scheme`](#color-scheme): specifies one or more color schemes with which the document is compatible.

The browser will use this information in tandem with the user's browser or device settings to determine what colors to use for everything from background and foregrounds to form controls and scrollbars. The primary use for `` is to indicate compatibility with—and order of preference for—light and dark color modes.

The value of the [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#content) property for `color-scheme` may be one of the following:

[`normal`](#normal)

The document is unaware of color schemes and should be rendered using the default color palette.

[`light`, `dark`, `light dark`, `dark light`](#light)

One or more color schemes supported by the document. Specifying the same color scheme more than once has the same effect as specifying it only once. Indicating multiple color schemes indicates that the first scheme is preferred by the document, but that the second specified scheme is acceptable if the user prefers it.

[`only light`](#only_light)

Indicates that the document *only* supports light mode, with a light background and dark foreground colors. By specification, `only dark` *is not valid*, because forcing a document to render in dark mode when it isn't truly compatible with it can result in unreadable content; all major browsers default to light mode if not otherwise configured.

For example, to indicate that a document prefers dark mode but does render functionally in light mode as well:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
This works at the document level in the same way that the CSS [`color-scheme`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) property lets individual elements specify their preferred and accepted color schemes. Your styles can adapt to the current color scheme using the [`prefers-color-scheme`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) CSS media feature.
### [Standard metadata names defined in other specifications](#standard_metadata_names_defined_in_other_specifications)

The CSS Device Adaptation specification defines the following metadata name:

* `viewport`: gives hints about the size of the initial size of the [viewport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport).

 Values for the content of
 ``

| Value | Possible subvalues | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | A positive integer number, or the text `device-width` | Defines the pixel width of the viewport that you want the website to be  rendered at. |
| `height` | A positive integer, or the text `device-height` | Defines the height of the viewport. Not used by any browser. |
| `initial-scale` | A positive number between `0.0` and `10.0` | Defines the ratio between the device width (`device-width` in  portrait mode or `device-height` in landscape mode) and the  viewport size. |
| `maximum-scale` | A positive number between `0.0` and `10.0` | Defines the maximum amount to zoom in. It must be greater or equal to  the `minimum-scale` or the behavior is undefined. Browser  settings can ignore this rule and iOS10\+ ignores it by default. |
| `minimum-scale` | A positive number between `0.0` and `10.0` | Defines the minimum zoom level. It must be smaller or equal to the  `maximum-scale` or the behavior is undefined. Browser  settings can ignore this rule and iOS10\+ ignores it by default. |
| `user-scalable` | `yes` or `no` | If set to `no`, the user is not able to zoom in the webpage.  The default is `yes`. Browser settings can ignore this rule,  and iOS10\+ ignores it by default. |
| `viewport-fit` | `auto`, `contain` or `cover` | The `auto` value doesn't affect the initial layout  viewport, and the whole web page is viewable.     The `contain` value means that the viewport is scaled to  fit the largest rectangle inscribed within the display.     The `cover` value means that the viewport is scaled to fill  the device display. It is highly recommended to make use of the  [safe area inset](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env) variables to  ensure that important content doesn't end up outside the display. |

**Warning:**

Disabling zooming capabilities by setting `user-scalable` to a value of `no` prevents people experiencing low vision conditions from being able to read and understand page content.

### [Other metadata names](#other_metadata_names)

The [WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions) contains a large set of non\-standard metadata names that have not been formally accepted yet; however, some of the names included there are already used quite commonly in practice — including the following:

* `creator`: the name of the creator of the document, such as an organization or institution. If there are more than one, several [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) elements should be used.
* `googlebot`, a synonym of `robots`, is only followed by Googlebot (the indexing crawler for Google).
* `publisher`: the name of the document's publisher.
* `robots`: the behavior that cooperative crawlers, or "robots", should use with the page. It is a comma\-separated list of the values below:

| Value | Description | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index` | Allows the robot to index the page (default). | All |
| `noindex` | Requests the robot to not index the page. | All |
| `follow` | Allows the robot to follow the links on the page (default). | All |
| `nofollow` | Requests the robot to not follow the links on the page. | All |
| `all` | Equivalent to `index, follow` | [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags?visit_id=637855965067987211-415685194&rd=1) |
| `none` | Equivalent to `noindex, nofollow` | [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags?visit_id=637855965074074862-574753619&rd=1) |
| `noarchive` | Requests the search engine not to cache the page content. | [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag), [Yahoo](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/search-for-desktop/SLN2213.html), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/which-robots-metatags-does-bing-support-5198d240) |
| `nosnippet` | Prevents displaying any description of the page in search engine results. | [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/which-robots-metatags-does-bing-support-5198d240) |
| `noimageindex` | Requests this page not to appear as the referring page of an indexed image. | [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag) |
| `nocache` | Synonym of `noarchive`. | [Bing](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/which-robots-metatags-does-bing-support-5198d240) |

**Note:**

	+ Only cooperative robots follow these rules. Do not expect to prevent email harvesters with them.
	+ The robot still needs to access the page in order to read these rules. To prevent bandwidth consumption, consider if using a *[robots.txt](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Robots.txt)* file is more appropriate.
	+ The `` element and `robots.txt` file serve different purposes: `robots.txt` controls the crawling of pages, and does not affect indexing or other behavior controlled by `robots` meta. A page that can't be crawled may still be indexed if it is referenced by another document.
	+ If you want to remove a page, `noindex` will work, but only after the robot visits the page again. Ensure that the `robots.txt` file is not preventing revisits.
	+ Some values are mutually exclusive, like `index` and `noindex`, or `follow` and `nofollow`. In these cases the robot's behavior is undefined and may vary between them.
	+ Some crawler robots, like Google, Yahoo and Bing, support the same values for the HTTP header [`X-Robots-Tag`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Robots-Tag); this allows non\-HTML documents like images to use these rules.

## <meter>: The HTML Meter element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`value`](#value)

The current numeric value. This must be between the minimum and maximum values (`min` attribute and `max` attribute) if they are specified. If unspecified or malformed, the value is `0`. If specified, but not within the range given by the `min` attribute and `max` attribute, the value is equal to the nearest end of the range.

**Note:**
Unless the `value` attribute is between `0` and `1` (inclusive), the `min` and `max` attributes should define the range so that the `value` attribute's value is within it.

[`min`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min)

The lower numeric bound of the measured range. This must be less than the maximum value (`max` attribute), if specified. If unspecified, the minimum value is `0`.

[`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max)

The upper numeric bound of the measured range. This must be greater than the minimum value (`min` attribute), if specified. If unspecified, the maximum value is `1`.

[`low`](#low)

The upper numeric bound of the low end of the measured range. This must be greater than the minimum value (`min` attribute), and it also must be less than the high value and maximum value (`high` attribute and `max` attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If unspecified, or if less than the minimum value, the `low` value is equal to the minimum value.

[`high`](#high)

The lower numeric bound of the high end of the measured range. This must be less than the maximum value (`max` attribute), and it also must be greater than the low value and minimum value (`low` attribute and `min` attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If unspecified, or if greater than the maximum value, the `high` value is equal to the maximum value.

[`optimum`](#optimum)

This attribute indicates the optimal numeric value. It must be within the range (as defined by the `min` attribute and `max` attribute). When used with the `low` attribute and `high` attribute, it gives an indication where along the range is considered preferable. For example, if it is between the `min` attribute and the `low` attribute, then the lower range is considered preferred. The browser may color the meter's bar differently depending on whether the value is less than or equal to the optimum value.

[`form`](#form)

This optional attribute is used to explicitly set a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) owner for the `` element. If omitted, the `` is associated with its ancestor `` element or the form association set by the `form` attribute on another ancestor element, such as on a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset), if any. If included, the value must be the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) of a `` in the same tree.

## <nav>: The Navigation Section element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a `` element. `` is intended only for a major block of navigation links; typically the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer) element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a `` element.
* A document may have several `` elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra\-page navigation. [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) can be used in such case to promote accessibility, see [example](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#labeling_section_content).
* User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of navigation\-only content.
## [Examples](#examples)

In this example, a `` block is used to contain an unordered list ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)) of links. With appropriate CSS, this can be presented as a sidebar, navigation bar, or drop\-down menu.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \\Home\\
 \\About\\
 \\Contact\\
 \
\

\`\`\`

The semantics of the `nav` element is that of providing links. However a `nav` element doesn't have to contain a list, it can contain other kinds of content as well. In this navigation block, links are provided in prose:

html\`\`\`
\
 \Navigation\
 \
 You are on my home page. To the north lies \my blog\, from
 whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
 mountain, upon which many \school papers\ are littered.
 Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
 desperately scribbling a \thesis\.
 \
 \
 To the west are several exits. One fun\-looking exit is labeled
 \"games"\. Another more
 boring\-looking exit is labeled \ISP™\.
 \
 \
 To the south lies a dark and dank \contacts page\.
 Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
 quickly out of the page.

## <nobr>: The Non-Breaking Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nobr)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element prevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text.

**Warning:**
Although this element is widely supported, it was *never* standard HTML, so you shouldn't use it. Instead, use the CSS property [`white-space`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space) like this:

## <noembed>: The Embed Fallback element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noembed)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an obsolete, non\-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed) element or do not support the type of [embedded content](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories#embedded_content) an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4\.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object) element.

**Note:**
While this element currently still works in many browsers, it is obsolete and should not be used. Use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object) instead, with fallback content between the opening and closing tags of the element.

## [Examples](#examples)

The message inside `` tag will appear only when your browser does not support `` tag.

## <noframes>: The Frame Fallback element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noframes)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame) element. Although most commonly\-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special\-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text\-mode browsers.

A `` element can contain any HTML elements that are allowed within the body of an HTML document, except for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame) elements, since using frames when they aren't supported doesn't make sense.

`` can be used to present a message explaining that the user's browser doesn't support frames, but ideally should be used to present an alternate form of the site that doesn't use frames but still offers the same or similar functionality.

**Note:**
This element is obsolete and shouldn't be used, since the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frame) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset) elements are also obsolete. When frames are needed at all, they should be presented using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) element.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes). It has no other attributes available.

## [Example](#example)

In this example, we see a frameset with two frames. In addition, `` is used to present an explanatory message if the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) doesn't support frames.

## <ol>: The Ordered List element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element also accepts the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`reversed`](#reversed)

This Boolean attribute specifies that the list's items are in reverse order. Items will be numbered from high to low.

[`start`](#start)

An integer to start counting from for the list items. Always an Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, etc.), even when the numbering `type` is letters or Roman numerals. For example, to start numbering elements from the letter "d" or the Roman numeral "iv," use `start="4"`.

[`type`](#type)

Sets the numbering type:

* `a` for lowercase letters
* `A` for uppercase letters
* `i` for lowercase Roman numerals
* `I` for uppercase Roman numerals
* `1` for numbers (default)

The specified type is used for the entire list unless a different [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li#type) attribute is used on an enclosed [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li) element.

**Note:**
Unless the type of the list number matters (like legal or technical documents where items are referenced by their number/letter), use the CSS [`list-style-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) property instead.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

Typically, ordered list items display with a preceding [marker](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker), such as a number or letter.

The `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) (or the synonym [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu)) elements may nest as deeply as desired, alternating between ``, `` (or ``) as needed.

The `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) elements both represent a list of items. The difference is with the `` element, the order is meaningful. For example:

* Steps in a recipe
* Turn\-by\-turn directions
* The list of ingredients in decreasing proportion on nutrition information labels

To determine which list to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning changes, use the `` element — otherwise you can use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) otherwise, or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu) if your list is a menu.

## <option>: The HTML Option element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to define an item contained in a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select), an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup), or a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) element. As such, `` can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)

If this Boolean attribute is set, this option is not checkable. Often browsers grey out such control and it won't receive any browsing event, like mouse clicks or focus\-related ones. If this attribute is not set, the element can still be disabled if one of its ancestors is a disabled [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup) element.

[`label`](#label)

This attribute is text for the label indicating the meaning of the option. If the `label` attribute isn't defined, its value is that of the element text content.

[`selected`](#selected)

If present, this Boolean attribute indicates that the option is initially selected. If the `` element is the descendant of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element whose [`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#multiple) attribute is not set, only one single `` of this [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element may have the `selected` attribute.

[`value`](#value)

The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option element.

## [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

Styling the **``** element is highly limited. Options don't inherit the font set on the parent. In Firefox, only [`color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) and [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) can be set, however in Chrome and Safari it's not possible to set any properties. You can find more details about styling in [our guide to advanced form styling](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Advanced_form_styling).

## <output>: The Output element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/for)

A space\-separated list of other elements' [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id)s, indicating that those elements contributed input values to (or otherwise affected) the calculation.

[`form`](#form)

The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element to associate the output with (its *form owner*). The value of this attribute must be the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) of a `` in the same document. (If this attribute is not set, the `` is associated with its ancestor `` element, if any.)

This attribute lets you associate `` elements to ``s anywhere in the document, not just inside a ``. It can also override an ancestor `` element. The `` element's name and content are not submitted when the form is submitted.

[`name`](#name)

The element's name. Used in the [`form.elements`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/elements "form.elements") API.

The `` value, name, and contents are NOT submitted during form submission.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Many browsers implement this element as an [`aria-live`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) region. Assistive technology will thereby announce the results of UI interactions posted inside it without requiring that focus is switched away from the controls that produce those results.

## [Examples](#examples)

In the following example, the form provides a slider whose value can range between `0` and `100`, and an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element into which you can enter a second number. The two numbers are added together, and the result is displayed in the `` element each time the value of any of the controls changes.

## <p>: The Paragraph element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first\-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Paragraphs are [block\-level elements](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content), and notably will automatically close if another block\-level element is parsed before the closing `` tag. See "Tag omission" below.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

**Note:**
The `align` attribute on `` tags is obsolete and shouldn't be used.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Breaking up content into paragraphs helps make a page more accessible. Screen\-readers and other assistive technology provide shortcuts to let their users skip to the next or previous paragraph, letting them skim content like how white space lets visual users skip around.

Using empty `` elements to add space between paragraphs is problematic for people who navigate with screen\-reading technology. Screen readers may announce the paragraph's presence, but not any content contained within it — because there is none. This can confuse and frustrate the person using the screen reader.

If extra space is desired, use [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS) properties like [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) to create the effect:

css\`\`\`
p {
 margin\-bottom: 2em; /\* increase white space after a paragraph \*/
}

\`\`\`## [Examples](#examples)

## [Styling paragraphs](#styling_paragraphs)

By default, browsers separate paragraphs with a single blank line. Alternate separation methods, such as first\-line indentation, can be achieved with [CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS):

### [HTML](#html_2)

html\`\`\`
\
 Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest for readers to scan, but
 they can also be separated by indenting their first lines. This is often used
 to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.
\

\
 Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school papers and rough drafts,
 uses both blank lines and indentation for separation. In finished works,
 combining both is considered redundant and amateurish.
\

\
 In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a special character: ¶,
 the \pilcrow\. Nowadays, this is considered claustrophobic and hard to
 read.
\

\
 How hard to read? See for yourself:

## <param>: The Object Parameter element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/param)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines parameters for an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object) element.

**Note:**
Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object) element with a [`data`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object#data) attribute to set the URL of an external resource.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`name` 
Deprecated](#name)

Name of the parameter.

[`value` 
Deprecated](#value)

Specifies the value of the parameter.

[`type` 
Deprecated](#type)

Only used if the `valuetype` is set to `ref`. Specifies the MIME type of values found at the URI specified by value.

[`valuetype` 
Deprecated](#valuetype)

Specifies the type of the `value` attribute. Possible values are:

* `data`: Default value. The value is passed to the object's implementation as a string.
* `ref`: The value is a URI to a resource where run\-time values are stored.
* `object`: An ID of another [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object) in the same document.

## <picture>: The Picture element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element contains zero or more [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) elements and one [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.

The browser will consider each child `` element and choose the best match among them. If no matches are found—or the browser doesn't support the `` element—the URL of the `` element's [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#src) attribute is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the `` element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

To decide which URL to load, the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) examines each ``'s [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#srcset), [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#media), and [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#type) attributes to select a compatible image that best matches the current layout and capabilities of the display device.

The `` element serves two purposes:

1. It describes the size and other attributes of the image and its presentation.
2. It provides a fallback in case none of the offered `` elements are able to provide a usable image.

Common use cases for ``:

* **Art direction.** Cropping or modifying images for different `media` conditions (for example, loading a simpler version of an image which has too many details, on smaller displays).
* **Offering alternative image formats**, for cases where certain formats are not supported.

**Note:**
For example, newer formats like [AVIF](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) or [WEBP](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) have many advantages, but might not be supported by the browser. A list of supported image formats can be found in: [Image file type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types).
* **Saving bandwidth and speeding page load times** by loading the most appropriate image for the viewer's display.

If providing higher\-density versions of an image for high\-DPI (Retina) display, use [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset) on the `` element instead. This lets browsers opt for lower\-density versions in data\-saving modes, and you don't have to write explicit `media` conditions.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes only [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

You can use the [`object-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property to adjust the positioning of the image within the element's frame, and the [`object-fit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property to control how the image is resized to fit within the frame.

**Note:**
Use these properties on the child `` element, **not** the `` element.

## [Examples](#examples)

These examples demonstrate how different attributes of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) element change the selection of the image inside ``.

### [The media attribute](#the_media_attribute)

The `media` attribute specifies a media condition (similar to a media query) that the user agent will evaluate for each [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) element.

If the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source)'s media condition evaluates to `false`, the browser skips it and evaluates the next element inside ``.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`### [The srcset attribute](#the_srcset_attribute)

The [srcset](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#srcset) attribute is used to offer a list of possible images based on size or the display's pixel density.

It is composed of a comma\-separated list of image descriptors. Each image descriptor is composed of a URL of the image, and *either*:

* a *width descriptor*, followed by a `w` (such as `300w`);
*OR*
* a *pixel density descriptor*, followed by an `x` (such as `2x`) to serve a high\-res image for high\-DPI screens.

Make sure to note that:

* width and pixel density descriptors should not be used together
* a missing pixel density descriptor implies 1x
* duplicate descriptor values are not allowed (2x \& 2x, 100w \& 100w)

The following example illustrates the usage of `srcset` attribute with the `` element to specify a high\-density and standard\-resolution image:

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
The `srcset` attribute can also be used on the `` element without needing the `` element. The following example demonstrates how to use the `srcset` attribute to specify standard\-resolution and high\-density images, respectively:

html\`\`\`
\

\`\`\`
The `sizes` attribute is not mandatory when using srcset, but it is recommended to use it in order to provide additional information to the browser to help it select the best image source.

Without sizes, the browser will use the default size of the image as specified by its dimensions in pixels. This may not be the best fit for all devices, especially if the image is displayed on different screen sizes or in different contexts.

Please note that sizes will have its effect only if width dimension descriptors are provided with srcset instead of pixel ratio values (200w instead of 2x for example).
For more information on using `srcset`, see the [Responsive images](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images) documentation.

### [The type attribute](#the_type_attribute)

The `type` attribute specifies a [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types) for the resource URL(s) in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) element's `srcset` attribute. If the user agent does not support the given type, the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) element is skipped.

## <plaintext>: The Plain Text element (Deprecated) - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/plaintext)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.

**Warning:**
Do not use this element.

* `` is deprecated since HTML 2, and not all browsers implemented it. Browsers that did implement it didn't do so consistently.
* `` is obsolete; browsers that accept it may instead treat it as a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre) element that still interprets HTML within.
* If `` is the first element on the page (other than any non\-displayed elements, like [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)), do not use HTML at all. Instead serve a text file with the `text/plain` [MIME\-type](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Configuring_server_MIME_types).
* Instead of ``, use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre) element or, if semantically accurate (such as for inline text), the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code) element. Escape any `` and `&` characters, to prevent browsers inadvertently parsing the element content as HTML.
* A monospaced font can be applied to any HTML element via a [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [`font-family`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) style with the `monospace` generic value.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

## <portal>: The Portal element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/portal)

**Experimental:** **This is an [experimental technology](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element enables the embedding of another HTML page into the current one for the purposes of allowing smoother navigation into new pages.

A `` is similar to an ``. An `` allows a separate [browsing context](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context) to be embedded. However, the embedded content of a `` is more limited than that of an ``. It cannot be interacted with, and therefore is not suitable for embedding widgets into a document. Instead, the `` acts as a preview of the content of another page. It can be navigated into therefore allowing for seamless transition to the embedded content.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy)

Sets the [referrer policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) to use when requesting the page at the URL given as the value of the `src` attribute.

[`src`](#src)

The URL of the page to embed.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The preview displayed by a `` is not interactive, therefore does not receive input events or focus. Therefore the embedded contents of the portal are not exposed as elements in the [accessibility tree](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree). The portal can be navigated to and activated like a button, the default behavior when clicking on the portal is to activate it.

Portals are given a default label which is the title of the embedded page. If no title is present the visible text in the preview is concatenated to create a label. The [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) attribute can be used to override this.

Portals used for prerendering only should be hidden with the hidden HTML attribute or the CSS [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property with a value of `none`.

When using animations during portal activation the [`prefers-reduced-motion`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) [media feature](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#media_features) should be respected.

## [Examples](#examples)

## <pre>: The Preformatted Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non\-proportional, or [monospaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font), font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.

By default, `` is a [block\-level](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) element, i.e. its default [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) value is `block`.

## [Try it](#try_it)

If you have to display reserved characters such as ``, `&`, and `"` within the `` tag, the characters must be escaped using their respective [character references](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_reference).

`` elements commonly contain [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) elements, to represent computer code, computer output, and user input, respectively.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`width` 
Deprecated

Non\-standard](#width)

Contains the *preferred* count of characters that a line should have. Though technically still implemented, this attribute has no visual effect; to achieve such an effect, use CSS [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) instead.

[`wrap` 
Non\-standard

Deprecated](#wrap)

Is a *hint* indicating how the overflow must happen. In modern browser this hint is ignored and no visual effect results in its present; to achieve such an effect, use CSS [`white-space`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space) instead.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

It is important to provide an alternate description for any images or diagrams created using preformatted text. The alternate description should clearly and concisely describe the image or diagram's content.

People experiencing low vision conditions and browsing with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader may not understand what the preformatted text characters are representing when they are read out in sequence.

A combination of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption) elements, supplemented by the [ARIA](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) `role` and [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) attributes on the `pre` element allow the preformatted [ASCII](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ASCII) art to be announced as an image with alternative text, and the `figcaption` serving as the image's caption.

## <progress>: The Progress Indicator element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`max`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max)

This attribute describes how much work the task indicated by the `progress` element requires. The `max` attribute, if present, must have a value greater than `0` and be a valid floating point number. The default value is `1`.

[`value`](#value)

This attribute specifies how much of the task that has been completed. It must be a valid floating point number between `0` and `max`, or between `0` and `1` if `max` is omitted. If there is no `value` attribute, the progress bar is indeterminate; this indicates that an activity is ongoing with no indication of how long it is expected to take.

**Note:**
Unlike the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter) element, the minimum value is always 0, and the `min` attribute is not allowed for the `` element.

**Note:**
The [`:indeterminate`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:indeterminate) pseudo\-class can be used to match against indeterminate progress bars. To change the progress bar to indeterminate after giving it a value you must remove the value attribute with [`element.removeAttribute('value')`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute "element.removeAttribute('value')").

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Labelling](#labelling)

In most cases you should provide an accessible label when using ``. While you can use the standard ARIA labelling attributes [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) as you would for any element with `role="progressbar"`, when using `` you can alternatively use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element.

**Note:**
Text placed between the element's tags is not an accessible label, it is only recommended as a fallback for old browsers that do not support this element.

### [Describing a particular region](#describing_a_particular_region)

If the `` element is describing the loading progress of a section of a page, use [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) to point to the status, and set [`aria-busy="true"`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-busy) on the section that is being updated, removing the `aria-busy` attribute when it has finished loading.

## <q>: The Inline Quotation element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`cite`](#cite)

The value of this attribute is a URL that designates a source document or message for the information quoted. This attribute is intended to point to information explaining the context or the reference for the quote.

## <rb>: The Ruby Base element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rb)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to delimit the base text component of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby) annotation, i.e. the text that is being annotated. One `` element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Ruby annotations are for showing pronunciation of East Asian characters, like using Japanese furigana or Taiwanese bopomofo characters. The `` element is used to separate out each segment of the ruby base text.
* Even though `` is not a [void element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element), it is common to just include the opening tag of each element in the source code, so that the ruby markup is less complex and easier to read. The browser can then fill in the full element in the rendered version.
* You need to include one [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rt) element for each base segment/`` element that you want to annotate.
## [Examples](#examples)

### [Using rb](#using_rb)

In this example, we provide an annotation for the original character equivalent of "Kanji":

html\`\`\`
\
 \漢\\字 \\(\\kan\\ji\\)\
\

\`\`\`
Note how we've included two `` elements, to delimit the two separate parts of the ruby base text. The annotation on the other hand is delimited by two [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rt) elements.

#### Result

### [Separate annotations](#separate_annotations)

Note that we could also write this example with the two base text parts annotated completely separately. In this case we don't need to include `` elements:

html\`\`\`
\
 漢 \(\\Kan\\)\ 字 \(\\ji\\)\
\

\`\`\`

## <rp>: The Ruby Fallback Parenthesis element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rp)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to provide fall\-back parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby annotations using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby) element. One `` element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/rt) element that contains the annotation's text.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* Ruby annotations are for showing pronunciation of East Asian characters, like using Japanese furigana or Taiwanese bopomofo characters. The `` element is used in the case of lack of [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby) element support; the `` content provides what should be displayed in order to indicate the presence of a ruby annotation, usually parentheses.
## [Examples](#examples)

### [Using ruby annotations](#using_ruby_annotations)

This example uses ruby annotations to display the [Romaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romaji) equivalents for each character.

html\`\`\`
\

\

\`\`\`

#### Result

See the article about the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby) element for further examples.

### [Without ruby support](#without_ruby_support)

## <s>: The Strikethrough element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the `` element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, `` is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins) elements, as appropriate.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The presence of the `s` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property, along with the [`::before`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and [`::after`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo\-elements.

css\`\`\`
s::before,
s::after {
 clip\-path: inset(100%);
 clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
 height: 1px;
 overflow: hidden;
 position: absolute;
 white\-space: nowrap;
 width: 1px;
}

s::before {
 content: " \[start of stricken text] ";
}

s::after {
 content: " \[end of stricken text] ";
}

\`\`\`
Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not knowing content has been struck out would adversely affect understanding.

## <samp>: The Sample Output element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as [Courier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)) or Lucida Console).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

You can use a CSS rule to override the browser's default font face for the `` element; however, it's possible that the browser's preferences may take precedence over any CSS you specify.

The CSS to override the default font face would look like this:

css\`\`\`
samp {
 font\-family: "Courier";
}

\`\`\`

**Note:**
If you need an element which will serve as a container for output generated by your website or app's JavaScript code, you should instead use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output) element.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic example](#basic_example)

In this basic example, a paragraph includes an example of the output of a program.

html\`\`\`
\
 When the process is complete, the utility will output the text
 \Scan complete. Found \N\ results.\ You can then proceed to
 the next step.
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Sample output including user input](#sample_output_including_user_input)

You can nest the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) element within a `` block to present an example that includes text entered by the user. For example, consider this text presenting a transcript of a Linux (or macOS) console session:

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
\\mike@interwebz:\~$\ \md5 \-s "Hello world"\
MD5 ("Hello world") = 3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62

\mike@interwebz:\~$\ \█\\\

\`\`\`
Note the use of [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) to allow customization of the appearance of specific portions of the sample text such as the shell prompts and the cursor. Note also the use of `` to represent the command the user entered at the prompt in the sample text.

#### CSS

The CSS that achieves the appearance we want is:

css\`\`\`
.prompt {
 color: \#b00;
}

samp \> kbd {
 font\-weight: bold;
}

.cursor {
 color: \#00b;
}

This gives the prompt and cursor fairly subtle colorization and emboldens the keyboard input within the sample text.

## <script>: The Script element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The `` element can also be used with other languages, such as [WebGL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)'s GLSL shader programming language and [JSON](/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON).

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`async`](#async)

For classic scripts, if the `async` attribute is present, then the classic script will be fetched in parallel to parsing and evaluated as soon as it is available.

For [module scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), if the `async` attribute is present then the scripts and all their dependencies will be fetched in parallel to parsing and evaluated as soon as they are available.

**Warning:**
This attribute must not be used if the `src` attribute is absent (i.e. for inline scripts) for classic scripts, in this case it would have no effect.

This attribute allows the elimination of **parser\-blocking JavaScript** where the browser would have to load and evaluate scripts before continuing to parse. `defer` has a similar effect in this case.

If the attribute is specified with the `defer` attribute, the element will act as if only the `async` attribute is specified.

This is a boolean attribute: the presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.

See [Browser compatibility](#browser_compatibility) for notes on browser support. See also [Async scripts for asm.js](/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Async_scripts).

[`attributionsrc` 
Experimental](#attributionsrc)

Specifies that you want the browser to send an [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header along with the script resource request. On the server\-side this is used to trigger sending an [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) or [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger) header in the response, to register a JavaScript\-based [attribution source](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_sources#javascript-based_event_sources) or [attribution trigger](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_triggers#javascript-based_attribution_triggers), respectively. Which response header should be sent back depends on the value of the `Attribution-Reporting-Eligible` header that triggered the registration.

**Note:**
Alternatively, JavaScript\-based attribution sources or triggers can be registered by sending a [`fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch "fetch()") request containing the `attributionReporting` option (either set directly on the `fetch()` call or on a [`Request`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object passed into the `fetch()` call), or by sending an [`XMLHttpRequest`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) with [`setAttributionReporting()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/setAttributionReporting "setAttributionReporting()") invoked on the request object.

There are two versions of this attribute that you can set:

* Boolean, i.e. just the `attributionsrc` name. This specifies that you want the [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header sent to the same server as the `src` attribute points to. This is fine when you are handling the attribution source or trigger registration on the same server. When registering an attribution trigger this property is optional, and an empty string value will be used if it is omitted.
* Value containing one or more URLs, for example:

html\`\`\`
\\

\`\`\`
This is useful in cases where the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In this case, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of `attributionsrc`. When the resource request occurs the [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in `attributionSrc` in addition to the resource origin. These URLs can then respond with a [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) or [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger) header as appropriate to complete registration.

**Note:**
Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.

See the [Attribution Reporting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API) for more details.

[`blocking`](#blocking)

This attribute explicitly indicates that certain operations should be blocked on the fetching of the script. The operations that are to be blocked must be a space\-separated list of blocking tokens listed below.

* `render`: The rendering of content on the screen is blocked.

[`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin)

Normal `script` elements pass minimal information to the [`window.onerror`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/error_event "window.onerror") for scripts which do not pass the standard [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) checks. To allow error logging for sites which use a separate domain for static media, use this attribute. See [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) for a more descriptive explanation of its valid arguments.

[`defer`](#defer)

This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed, but before firing [`DOMContentLoaded`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event "DOMContentLoaded") event.

Scripts with the `defer` attribute will prevent the `DOMContentLoaded` event from firing until the script has loaded and finished evaluating.

**Warning:**
This attribute must not be used if the `src` attribute is absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case it would have no effect.

The `defer` attribute has no effect on [module scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) — they defer by default.

Scripts with the `defer` attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document.

This attribute allows the elimination of **parser\-blocking JavaScript** where the browser would have to load and evaluate scripts before continuing to parse. `async` has a similar effect in this case.

If the attribute is specified with the `async` attribute, the element will act as if only the `async` attribute is specified.

[`fetchpriority`](#fetchpriority)

Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching an external script.
Allowed values:

[`high`](#high)

Fetch the external script at a high priority relative to other external scripts.

[`low`](#low)

Fetch the external script at a low priority relative to other external scripts.

[`auto`](#auto)

Don't set a preference for the fetch priority.
This is the default.
It is used if no value or an invalid value is set.

See [`HTMLScriptElement.fetchPriority`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLScriptElement/fetchPriority) for more information.

[`integrity`](#integrity)

This attribute contains inline metadata that a user agent can use to verify that a fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation. The attribute must not specified when the `src` attribute is not specified. See [Subresource Integrity](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).

[`nomodule`](#nomodule)

This Boolean attribute is set to indicate that the script should not be executed in browsers that support [ES modules](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) — in effect, this can be used to serve fallback scripts to older browsers that do not support modular JavaScript code.

[`nonce`](#nonce)

A cryptographic nonce (number used once) to allow scripts in a [script\-src Content\-Security\-Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src). The server must generate a unique nonce value each time it transmits a policy. It is critical to provide a nonce that cannot be guessed as bypassing a resource's policy is otherwise trivial.

[`referrerpolicy`](#referrerpolicy)

Indicates which [referrer](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/referrer) to send when fetching the script, or resources fetched by the script:

* `no-referrer`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent.
* `no-referrer-when-downgrade`: The [`Referer`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header will not be sent to [origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin)s without [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) ([HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS)).
* `origin`: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring page: its [scheme](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL), [host](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Host), and [port](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Port).
* `origin-when-cross-origin`: The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
* `same-origin`: A referrer will be sent for [same origin](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Same-origin_policy), but cross\-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
* `strict-origin`: Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (default): Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin request, only send the origin when the protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
* `unsafe-url`: The referrer will include the origin *and* the path (but not the [fragment](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/hash), [password](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/password), or [username](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAnchorElement/username)). **This value is unsafe**, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS\-protected resources to insecure origins.

**Note:**
An empty string value (`""`) is both the default value, and a fallback value if `referrerpolicy` is not supported. If `referrerpolicy` is not explicitly specified on the `` element, it will adopt a higher\-level referrer policy, i.e. one set on the whole document or domain. If a higher\-level policy is not available, the empty string is treated as being equivalent to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

[`src`](#src)

This attribute specifies the URI of an external script; this can be used as an alternative to embedding a script directly within a document.

[`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type)

This attribute indicates the type of script represented.
The value of this attribute will be one of the following:

[**Attribute is not set (default), an empty string, or a JavaScript MIME type**](#attribute_is_not_set_default_an_empty_string_or_a_javascript_mime_type)

Indicates that the script is a "classic script", containing JavaScript code.
Authors are encouraged to omit the attribute if the script refers to JavaScript code rather than specify a MIME type.
JavaScript MIME types are [listed in the IANA media types specification](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types#textjavascript).

[`importmap`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)

This value indicates that the body of the element contains an import map.
The import map is a JSON object that developers can use to control how the browser resolves module specifiers when importing [JavaScript modules](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_modules_using_import_maps).

[`module`](#module)

This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module.
The processing of the script contents is deferred.
The `charset` and `defer` attributes have no effect.
For information on using `module`, see our [JavaScript modules](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) guide.
Unlike classic scripts, module scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for cross\-origin fetching.

[`speculationrules`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/speculationrules) 
Experimental

This value indicates that the body of the element contains speculation rules.
Speculation rules take the form of a JSON object that determine what resources should be prefetched or prerendered by the browser. This is part of the [Speculation Rules API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API).

[**Any other value**](#any_other_value)

The embedded content is treated as a data block, and won't be processed by the browser.
Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks.
All of the other attributes will be ignored, including the `src` attribute.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

[`charset` 
Deprecated](#charset)

If present, its value must be an [ASCII](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ASCII) case\-insensitive match for `utf-8`. It's unnecessary to specify the `charset` attribute, because documents must use UTF\-8, and the `script` element inherits its character encoding from the document.

[`language` 
Deprecated

Non\-standard](#language)

Like the `type` attribute, this attribute identifies the scripting language in use. Unlike the `type` attribute, however, this attribute's possible values were never standardized. The `type` attribute should be used instead.

## [Notes](#notes)

Scripts without [`async`](#async), [`defer`](#defer) or `type="module"` attributes, as well as inline scripts without the `type="module"` attribute, are fetched and executed immediately before the browser continues to parse the page.

The script should be served with the `text/javascript` MIME type, but browsers are lenient and only block them if the script is served with an image type (`image/*`), a video type (`video/*`), an audio type (`audio/*`), or `text/csv`.
If the script is blocked, an [`error`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/error_event "error") event is sent to the element; otherwise, a [`load`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/load_event "load") event is sent.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic usage](#basic_usage)

These examples show how to import (an external) script using the `` element.

html\`\`\`
\\

\`\`\`
And the following examples show how to put (an inline) script inside the `` element.

html\`\`\`
\
 alert("Hello World!");
\

\`\`\`### [async and defer](#async_and_defer)

Scripts loaded using the `async` attribute will download the script without blocking the page while the script is being fetched.
However, once the download is complete, the script will execute, which blocks the page from rendering. This means that the rest of the content on the web page is prevented from being processed and displayed to the user until the script finishes executing.
You get no guarantee that scripts will run in any specific order.
It is best to use `async` when the scripts in the page run independently from each other and depend on no other script on the page.

Scripts loaded with the `defer` attribute will load in the order they appear on the page.
They won't run until the page content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).

Here is a visual representation of the different script loading methods and what that means for your page:



*This image is from the [HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/images/asyncdefer.svg), copied and cropped to a reduced version, under [CC BY 4\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license terms.*

For example, if you have the following script elements:

html\`\`\`
\\
\\
\\

\`\`\`
You can't rely on the order the scripts will load in.
`jquery.js` may load before or after `script2.js` and `script3.js` and if this is the case, any functions in those scripts depending on `jquery` will produce an error because `jquery` will not be defined at the time the script runs.

`async` should be used when you have a bunch of background scripts to load in, and you just want to get them in place as soon as possible.
For example, maybe you have some game data files to load, which will be needed when the game actually begins, but for now you just want to get on with showing the game intro, titles, and lobby, without them being blocked by script loading.

Scripts loaded using the `defer` attribute (see below) will run in the order they appear in the page and execute them as soon as the script and content are downloaded:

html\`\`\`
\\
\\
\\

\`\`\`
In the second example, we can be sure that `jquery.js` will load before `script2.js` and `script3.js` and that `script2.js` will load before `script3.js`.
They won't run until the page content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).

To summarize:

* `async` and `defer` both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked during the fetch process.
* scripts with an `async` attribute will execute as soon as the download is complete.
This blocks the page and does not guarantee any specific execution order.
* scripts with a `defer` attribute will load in the order they are in and will only execute once everything has finished loading.
* If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use `async`.
* If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using `defer` and put their corresponding `` elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
### [Module fallback](#module_fallback)

Browsers that support the `module` value for the [`type`](#type) attribute ignore any script with a `nomodule` attribute. That enables you to use module scripts while providing `nomodule`\-marked fallback scripts for non\-supporting browsers.

html\`\`\`
\\
\\

\`\`\`### [Importing modules with importmap](#importing_modules_with_importmap)

When importing modules in scripts, if you don't use the [`type=importmap`](#importmap) feature, then each module must be imported using a module specifier that is either an absolute or relative URL.
In the example below, the first module specifier ("./shapes/square.js") resolves relative to the base URL of the document, while the second is an absolute URL.

js\`\`\`
import { name as squareName, draw } from "./shapes/square.js";
import { name as circleName } from "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js";

\`\`\`
An import map allows you to provide a mapping that, if matched, can replace the text in the module specifier.
The import map below defines keys `square` and `circle` that can be used as aliases for the module specifiers shown above.

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "imports": {
 "square": "./shapes/square.js",
 "circle": "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js"
 }
 }
\

\`\`\`
This allows us to import modules using names in the module specifier (rather than absolute or relative URLs).

js\`\`\`
import { name as squareName, draw } from "square";
import { name as circleName } from "circle";

\`\`\`
For more examples of what you can do with import maps, see the [Importing modules using import maps](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_modules_using_import_maps) section in the JavaScript modules guide.

### [Embedding data in HTML](#embedding_data_in_html)

You can also use the `` element to embed data in HTML with server\-side rendering by specifying a valid non\-JavaScript MIME type in the `type` attribute.

html\`\`\`
\
\
 {
 "userId": 1234,
 "userName": "Maria Cruz",
 "memberSince": "2000\-01\-01T00:00:00\.000Z"
 }
\

\
\
 const userInfo = JSON.parse(document.getElementById("data").text);
 console.log("User information: %o", userInfo);
\

\`\`\`### [Blocking rendering till a script is fetched and executed](#blocking_rendering_till_a_script_is_fetched_and_executed)

You can include `render` token inside a `blocking` attribute;
the rendering of the page will be blocked till the script is fetched and executed. In the example below, we block rendering on an async script,
so that the script doesn't block parsing but is guaranteed to be evaluated before rendering starts.

html\`\`\`

## <script>: type attribute - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type)

The **`type`** attribute of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) element indicates the *type* of script represented by the element: a classic script, an import map, a JavaScript module, speculation rules, or a data block.

## [Value](#value)

The value of this attribute indicates the type of data represented by the script, and will be one of the following:

[**Attribute is not set (default), an empty string, or a JavaScript MIME type**](#attribute_is_not_set_default_an_empty_string_or_a_javascript_mime_type)

Indicates that the script is a "classic script", containing JavaScript code.
Authors are encouraged to omit the attribute if the script refers to JavaScript code rather than specify a MIME type.
JavaScript MIME types are [listed in the IANA media types specification](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types#textjavascript).

[`importmap`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)

This value indicates that the body of the element contains an import map.
The import map is a JSON object that developers can use to control how the browser resolves module specifiers when importing [JavaScript modules](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_modules_using_import_maps).

[`module`](#module)

This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module.
The processing of the script contents is deferred.
The `charset` and `defer` attributes have no effect.
For information on using `module`, see our [JavaScript modules](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) guide.
Unlike classic scripts, module scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for cross\-origin fetching.

[`speculationrules`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/speculationrules) 
Experimental

This value indicates that the body of the element contains speculation rules.
Speculation rules take the form of a JSON object that determine what resources should be prefetched or prerendered by the browser. This is part of the [Speculation Rules API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API).

[**Any other value**](#any_other_value)

The embedded content is treated as a data block, and won't be processed by the browser.
Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks.
All of the other attributes will be ignored, including the `src` attribute.

**Note:**
In earlier browsers, the type identified the scripting language of the embedded or imported (via the `src` attribute) code.

## [Specifications](#specifications)

## <script type="importmap"> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)

The **`importmap`** value of the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type) attribute of the [`` element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) indicates that the body of the element contains an import map.

An import map is a JSON object that allows developers to control how the browser resolves module specifiers when importing [JavaScript modules](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
It provides a mapping between the text used as the module specifier in an [`import` statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) or [`import()` operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import), and the corresponding value that will replace the text when resolving the specifier.
The JSON object must conform to the [Import map JSON representation format](#import_map_json_representation).

An import map is used to resolve module specifiers in static and dynamic imports, and therefore must be declared and processed before any `` elements that import modules using specifiers declared in the map.
Note that the import map applies only to module specifiers in the [`import` statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) or [`import()` operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) for modules loaded into documents; it does not apply to the path specified in the `src` attribute of a `` element or to modules loaded into workers or worklets.

For more information, see the [Importing modules using import maps](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#importing_modules_using_import_maps) section in the JavaScript modules guide.

## [Syntax](#syntax)

html\`\`\`
\
 // JSON object defining import
\

\`\`\`
The `src`, `async`, `nomodule`, `defer`, `crossorigin`, `integrity`, and `referrerpolicy` attributes must not be specified.

Only the first import map in the document with an inline definition is processed; any additional import maps and external import maps are ignored.

### [Exceptions](#exceptions)

[`TypeError`](#typeerror)

The import map definition is not a JSON object, the `importmap` key is defined but its value is not a JSON object, or the `scopes` key is defined but its value is not a JSON object.

Browsers generate console warnings for other cases where the import map JSON does not conform to the [import map](#import_map_json_representation) schema.

An [`error` event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/error_event) is fired at script elements with `type="importmap"` that are not processed.
This might occur, for example, if module loading has already started when an import map is processed, or if multiple import maps are defined in the page.

## [Description](#description)

When importing a [JavaScript module](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), both the [`import` statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [`import()` operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) have a "module specifier" that indicates the module to be imported.
A browser must be able to resolve this specifier to an absolute URL in order to import the module.

For example, the following statements import elements from the module specifier `"./modules/shapes/square.js"`, which is a path relative to the base URL of the document, and the module specifier `"https://example.com/shapes/circle.js"`, which is an absolute URL.

js\`\`\`
import { name as squareName, draw } from "./modules/shapes/square.js";
import { name as circleName } from "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js";

\`\`\`
Import maps allow developers to specify (almost) any text they want in the module specifier; the map provides a corresponding value that will replace the text when the module specifier is resolved.

### [Bare modules](#bare_modules)

The import map below defines an `imports` key that has a "module specifier map" with properties `square` and `circle`.

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "imports": {
 "square": "./module/shapes/square.js",
 "circle": "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js"
 }
 }
\

\`\`\`
With this import map we can import the same modules as above, but using "bare modules" in our module specifiers:

js\`\`\`
import { name as squareName, draw } from "square";
import { name as circleName } from "circle";

\`\`\`### [Mapping path prefixes](#mapping_path_prefixes)

A module specifier map key can also be used to remap a path prefix in a module specifier.
Note that in this case the property and mapped path must both have a trailing forward slash (`/`).

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "imports": {
 "shapes/": "./module/shapes/",
 "other\-shapes/": "https://example.com/modules/shapes/"
 }
 }
\

\`\`\`
We could then import a circle module as shown.

js\`\`\`
import { name as circleName } from "shapes/circle.js";

\`\`\`### [Paths in the module specifier map key](#paths_in_the_module_specifier_map_key)

Module specifier keys do not have to be single word names ("bare names").
They can also contain or end with path separators, or be absolute URLs, or be relative URL paths that start with `/`, `./`, or `../`.

json\`\`\`
{
 "imports": {
 "modules/shapes/": "./module/src/shapes/",
 "modules/square": "./module/src/other/shapes/square.js",
 "https://example.com/modules/square.js": "./module/src/other/shapes/square.js",
 "../modules/shapes/": "/modules/shapes/"
 }
}

\`\`\`
If there are several module specifier keys in a module specifier map that might match, then the most specific key will be selected (i.e. the one with the longer path/value).

A module specifier of `./foo/../js/app.js` would be resolved to `./js/app.js` before matching.
This means that a module specifier key of `./js/app.js` would match the module specifier even though they are not exactly the same.

### [Scoped module specifier maps](#scoped_module_specifier_maps)

You can use the `scopes` key to provide mappings that are only used if the script importing the module contains a particular URL path.
If the URL of the loading script matches the supplied path, the mapping associated with the scope will be used.
This allows different versions of the module to be used depending on what code is doing the importing.

For example, the map below will only use the scoped map if the loading module has a URL that includes the path: "/modules/custom\-shapes/".

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "imports": {
 "square": "./module/shapes/square.js"
 },
 "scopes": {
 "/modules/custom\-shapes/": {
 "square": "https://example.com/modules/shapes/square.js"
 }
 }
 }
\

\`\`\`
If multiple scopes match the referrer URL, then the most specific scope path is used (the scope key name with the longest name).
The browser falls back to the next most specific scoped path if there is no matching specifier, and so on, eventually falling back to the module specifier map in the `imports` key.

### [Integrity metadata map](#integrity_metadata_map)

You can use the `integrity` key to provide mapping for module [integrity metadata](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity#using_subresource_integrity).
This enables you to ensure the integrity of dynamically or statically imported modules.
`integrity` also enables you to provide a fallback for top\-level or preloaded modules, in case they don't already include an `integrity` attribute.

The map keys represent module URLs, which can be absolute or relative (starting with `/`, `./`, or `../`).
The map values represent integrity metadata, identical to that used in [`integrity`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#integrity) attribute values.

For example, the map below defines integrity metadata for the `square.js` module (directly) and its bare specifier (transitively, via the `imports` key).

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "imports": {
 "square": "./module/shapes/square.js"
 },
 "integrity": {
 "./module/shapes/square.js": "sha384\-oqVuAfXRKap7fdgcCY5uykM6\+R9GqQ8K/uxy9rx7HNQlGYl1kPzQho1wx4JwY8wC"
 }
 }
\

\`\`\`## [Import map JSON representation](#import_map_json_representation)

The following is a "formal" definition of the import map JSON representation.

The import map must be a valid JSON object that can define any of the optional keys `imports`, `scopes` and `integrity`. Each key's value must be an object, which may be empty.

[`imports` Optional](#imports)

The value is a [module specifier map](#module_specifier_map), which provides the mappings between module specifier text that might appear in an `import` statement or `import()` operator, and the text that will replace it when the specifier is resolved.

This is the fallback map that is searched for matching module specifiers if no `scopes` path URLs match, or if module specifier maps in matching `scopes` paths do not contain a key that matches the module specifier.

[``](#module_specifier_map)

A "module specifier map" is a valid JSON object where the *keys* are text that may be present in the module specifier when importing a module, and the corresponding *values* are the URLs or paths that will replace this text when the module specifier is resolved to an address.

The module specifier map JSON object has the following requirements:

* None of the keys may be empty.
* All of the values must be strings, defining either a valid absolute URL or a valid URL string that starts with `/`, `./`, or `../`.
* If a key ends with `/`, then the corresponding value must also end with `/`.
A key with a trailing `/` can be used as a prefix for when mapping (or remapping) modules addresses.
* The object properties' ordering is irrelevant: if multiple keys can match the module specifier, the most specific key is used (in other words, a specifier "olive/branch/" would match before "olive/").

[`integrity` Optional](#integrity)

Defines a valid JSON object where the *keys* are strings containing valid absolute or relative URLs (starting with `/`, `./`, or `../`),
and the corresponding *values* are valid [integrity metadata](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity#using_subresource_integrity).

If the URL of a script importing or preloading a module matches a key in the `integrity` object, the corresponding integrity metadata is applied to the script's fetch options,
unless they already have integrity metadata attached to them.

[`scopes` Optional](#scopes)

Scopes define path\-specific [module specifier maps](#module_specifier_map), allowing the choice of map to depend on the path of the code importing the module.

The scopes object is a valid JSON object where each property is a ``, which is an URL path, with a corresponding value that is a ``.

If the URL of a script importing a module matches a `` path, then the `` value associated with the key is checked for matching specifiers first.
If there are multiple matching scope keys, then the value associated with the most specific/nested scope paths are checked for matching module specifiers first.
The fallback module specifier map in `imports` is used if there are no matching module specifier keys in any of the matching scoped module specifier maps.

Note that the scope does not change how an address is resolved; relative addresses are always resolved to the import map base URL.

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/speculationrules)

**Experimental:** **This is an [experimental technology](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental)**  
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The **`speculationrules`** value of the [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type) attribute of the [`` element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) indicates that the body of the element contains speculation rules.

Speculation rules take the form of a JSON structure that determine what resources should be prefetched or prerendered by the browser. This is part of the [Speculation Rules API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API).

**Note:**
Speculation rules can be defined inside external text files referenced by the [`Speculation-Rules`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Speculation-Rules) HTTP header, using the same [JSON representation provided below](#speculation_rules_json_representation). Specifying an HTTP header is useful in cases where developers are not able to directly modify the document itself.

## [Syntax](#syntax)

html\`\`\`
\
 // JSON object defining rules
\

\`\`\`

**Note:**
The `src`, `async`, `nomodule`, `defer`, `crossorigin`, `integrity`, and `referrerpolicy` attributes must not be specified.

### [Exceptions](#exceptions)

[`TypeError`](#typeerror)

The speculation rules definition is not a valid JSON object.

## [Description](#description)

A `` element must contain a valid JSON structure that defines speculation rules. The following examples show separate prefetch and prerender rules:

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prefetch": \[
 {
 "urls": \["next.html", "next2\.html"],
 "requires": \["anonymous\-client\-ip\-when\-cross\-origin"],
 "referrer\_policy": "no\-referrer"
 }
 ]
 }
\

\`\`\`
html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prerender": \[
 {
 "where": { "href\_matches": "/next" },
 "eagerness": "eager"
 }
 ]
 }
\

\`\`\`### [Speculation rules JSON representation](#speculation_rules_json_representation)

The JSON structure contains one or more fields at the top level, each one representing an action to define speculation rules for. At present the supported actions are:

[`"prefetch"` Optional 
Experimental](#prefetch)

Rules for potential future navigations that should have their associated document response body downloaded, leading to significant performance improvements when those documents are navigated to. Note that none of the subresources referenced by the page are downloaded.

[`"prerender"` Optional 
Experimental](#prerender)

Rules for potential future navigations that should have their associated documents fully downloaded, rendered, and loaded into an invisible tab. This includes loading all subresources, running all JavaScript, and even loading subresources and performing data fetches started by JavaScript. When those documents are navigated to, navigations will be instant, leading to major performance improvements.

**Note:**
Consult the [Speculation Rules API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) main page for full details on how to use prefetch and prerender effectively.

Each action field contains an array, which in turn contains one or more objects. Each object contains a single rule defining a set of URLs and related parameters.

Each object can contain the following properties:

[`"source"`](#source)

A string indicating the source of the URLs to which the rule applies. This is optional because the value can always be inferred from other properties.

This can be one of:

[`"document"`](#document)

Specifies that the URLs will be matched from navigation links in the associated document (as defined in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements), based on the conditions described by a `"where"` key. Note that the presence of a `"where"` key implies `"source": "document"`, so it is optional.

[`"list"`](#list)

Specifies that the URLs will come from a list, specified in the `"urls"` key. Note that the presence of a `"urls"` key implies `"source": "list"`, so it is optional.

[`"urls"` 
Experimental](#urls)

An array of strings representing a list of URLs to apply the rule to. These can be absolute or relative URLs. Relative URLs will be parsed relative to the document base URL (if inline in a document) or relative to the external resource URL (if externally fetched). `"urls"` and `"where"` cannot both be set in the same rule.

[`"where"` 
Experimental](#where)

An object representing the conditions by which the rule matches URLs contained in the associated document. Effectively, the `"where"` object represents a test that is performed on every link on the page to see whether the speculation rule is applied to it. `"where"` and `"urls"` cannot both be set in the same rule.

This object can contain exactly one of the following properties:

[`"href_matches"`](#href_matches)

A string containing a URL pattern, or an array containing multiple URL pattern strings, which follow the standard [URL Pattern API syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API). Links in the document whose URLs match the pattern(s) will have the rule applied.

[`"relative_to"`](#relative_to)

In the case of an `"href_matches"` condition, this can specify where you want that condition to be matched relative to. This works in exactly the same way as the [rule\-level `"relative_to"` key](#relative_to_2), except that it only affects a single `"href_matches"` condition inside a `"where"` key.

[`"selector_matches"`](#selector_matches)

A string containing a [CSS selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors), or an array containing multiple CSS selectors. Links in the document matched by those selectors will have the rule applied.

[`"and"`](#and)

An array containing one or more objects containing conditions (`"href_matches"`, `"selector_matches"`, `"and"`, `"not"`, or `"or"`), all of which must match for the rule to be applied to them.

[`"not"`](#not)

An object containing one condition (`"href_matches"`, `"selector_matches"`, `"and"`, `"not"`, or `"or"`) which, if it matches, will *not* have the rule applied to it. All links that *do not* match the condition *will* have the rule applied.

[`"or"`](#or)

An array containing one or more objects containing conditions (`"href_matches"`, `"selector_matches"`, `"and"`, `"not"`, or `"or"`), any of which can match for the rule to be applied to them.

`"where"` conditions can be nested multiple levels deep to create complex conditions, or you can choose to split them into separate rules to keep them simple. See [where examples](#where_syntax_examples) for more explanation, and multiple examples of use.

[`"eagerness"` 
Experimental](#eagerness)

A string providing a hint to the browser as to how eagerly it should prefetch/prerender link targets in order to balance performance advantages against resource overheads. Possible values are:

[`"immediate"`](#immediate)

The author thinks the link is very likely to be followed, and/or the document may take significant time to fetch. Prefetch/prerender should start as soon as possible, subject only to considerations such as user preferences and resource limits.

[`"eager"`](#eager)

The author wants to prefetch/prerender a large number of navigations, as early as possible. Prefetch/prerender should start on any slight suggestion that a link may be followed. For example, the user could move their mouse cursor towards the link, hover/focus it for a moment, or pause scrolling with the link in a prominent place.

[`"moderate"`](#moderate)

The author is looking for a balance between `eager` and `conservative`. Prefetch/prerender should start when there is a reasonable suggestion that the user will follow a link in the near future. For example, the user could scroll a link into the viewport and hover/focus it for some time.

[`"conservative"`](#conservative)

The author wishes to get some benefit from speculative loading with a fairly small tradeoff of resources. Prefetch/prerender should start only when the user is starting to click on the link, for example on [`mousedown`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event "mousedown") or [`pointerdown`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerdown_event "pointerdown").

If `"eagerness"` is not explicitly specified, list (`"urls"`) rules default to `immediate` and document (`"where"`) rules default to `conservative`. The browser takes this hint into consideration along with its own heuristics, so it may select a link that the author has hinted as less eager than another, if the less eager candidate is considered a better choice.

[`"expects_no_vary_search"` 
Experimental](#expects_no_vary_search)

A string providing a hint to the browser as to what [`No-Vary-Search`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/No-Vary-Search) header value will be set on responses for documents that it is receiving prefetch/prerender requests for. The browser can use this to determine ahead of time whether it is more useful to wait for an existing prefetch/prerender to finish, or start a new fetch request when the speculation rule is matched. See the [`"expects_no_vary_search"` example](#expects_no_vary_search_example) for more explanation of how this can be used.

[`"referrer_policy"` 
Experimental](#referrer_policy)

A string representing a specific referrer policy string to use when requesting the URLs specified in the rule — see [`Referrer-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) for possible values. The purpose of this is to allow the referring page to set a stricter policy specifically for the speculative request than the policy the page already has set (either by default, or by using `Referrer-Policy`).

**Note:**
A cross\-site prefetch requires a referrer policy that is at least as strict as the default `"strict-origin-when-cross-origin"` value — so `"strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`, `"same-origin"`, `"strict-origin"`, or `"no-referrer"`. A laxer policy set in the speculation rules will override a stricter policy set on the referring page as long as it is still sufficiently strict for the cross\-site case.

**Note:**
In the case of document rules, the matched link's specified referrer policy (e.g. using the [`referrerpolicy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#referrerpolicy) attribute) will be used, unless the rule specifies a policy that overrides it.

[`"relative_to"` 
Experimental](#relative_to_2)

A string specifying where you want links matched by URL to be matched relative to. The value can be one of:

[`document`](#document_2)

URLs should be matched relative to the document the speculation rules are being set on.

[`ruleset`](#ruleset)

URLs should be matched relative to the file the rules are specified in. This is the default value.

This key setting is only relevant for rules defined in an external file (set using the [`Speculation-Rules`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Speculation-Rules) header). When rules are specified inside the same document they are being set for (i.e. in an inline `` element), it makes no difference.

[`"requires"` 
Experimental](#requires)

An array of strings representing capabilities of the browser parsing the rule, which must be available if the rule is to be applied to the specified URLs.

**Warning:**
Prefetches will automatically fail in browsers that cannot meet a specified requirement, even if they support the [Speculation Rules API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API).

Possible values are:

[`"anonymous-client-ip-when-cross-origin"`](#anonymous-client-ip-when-cross-origin)

(prefetch\-only) Specifies that the rule matches only if the user agent can prevent the client IP address from being visible to the origin server if a cross\-origin prefetch request is issued. Exactly how this works is dependent on browser implementation specifics. For example:

* Chrome's implementation hides the IP address using a Google\-owned proxy, therefore by default it only works for Google\-controlled referrers (since in that case, sending the URLs of the destination to Google is not an additional privacy leak). When used on a non\-Google\-owned site, rules that include this will only match for users that turn on "Enhanced preloading" in `chrome://settings/preloading`.
* Other Chromium\-based browsers will have to provide their own solutions. Thorough testing in all target browsers is advised.
* A future Safari implementation may possibly use something along the lines of [iCloud Private Relay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602).
* A future Firefox implementation might use something based on the [Mozilla VPN](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/) product.

**Note:**
As speculation rules use a `` element, they need to be explicitly allowed in the [`Content-Security-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) [`script-src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) directive if the site includes it. This is done by adding the `"inline-speculation-rules"` value along with a hash\- or nonce\-source.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Prefetch and prerender in the same set of rules](#prefetch_and_prerender_in_the_same_set_of_rules)

The basic examples shown in the description section included separate speculation rules defined for prefetch and prerender. It is possible to define both in a single set of rules:

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prefetch": \[
 {
 "urls": \["next.html", "next2\.html"],
 "requires": \["anonymous\-client\-ip\-when\-cross\-origin"],
 "referrer\_policy": "no\-referrer"
 }
 ],
 "prerender": \[
 {
 "where": { "selector\_matches": ".product\-link" },
 "eagerness": "eager"
 }
 ]
 }
\

\`\`\`

**Note:**
This code snippet provides a list (`"urls"`) rule and a document (`"where"`) rule example.

### [Multiple rule sets](#multiple_rule_sets)

It is also allowable to include multiple sets of rules in a single HTML file:

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prefetch": \[
 {
 "urls": \["next.html", "next2\.html"],
 "requires": \["anonymous\-client\-ip\-when\-cross\-origin"],
 "referrer\_policy": "no\-referrer"
 }
 ]
 }
\
\
 {
 "prerender": \[
 {
 "where": { "selector\_matches": ".product\-link" },
 "eagerness": "eager"
 }
 ]
 }
\

\`\`\`
And multiple rules in a single result set:

js\`\`\`
\
{
 "prerender": \[
 {
 "urls": \["one.html"]
 },
 {
 "urls": \["two.html"]
 }
 ]
}
\

\`\`\`### [Dynamic rule insertion](#dynamic_rule_insertion)

Below is an example that feature detects speculation rules and, if supported, dynamically adds a prerender speculation rule via JavaScript:

js\`\`\`
if (
 HTMLScriptElement.supports \&\&
 HTMLScriptElement.supports("speculationrules")
) {
 const specScript = document.createElement("script");
 specScript.type = "speculationrules";
 const specRules = {
 prerender: \[
 {
 urls: \["/next.html"],
 },
 ],
 };
 specScript.textContent = JSON.stringify(specRules);
 console.log("added speculation rules to: next.html");
 document.body.append(specScript);
}

\`\`\`
You can see this in action in this [prerender demos](https://prerender-demos.glitch.me/) page.

### [`where` syntax examples](#where_syntax_examples)

A document\-sourced rule contains a `"where"` property, which is an object containing criteria that define which links in the document are matched. Effectively, the `"where"` object represents a test that is performed on every link on the page to see whether the speculation rule is applied to it.

The most basic version will match a single URL pattern or CSS selector:

json\`\`\`
{ "where": { "href\_matches": "/next" } }

\`\`\`
json\`\`\`
{ "where": { "selector\_matches": ".important\-link" } }

\`\`\`
`"href_matches"` and `"selector_matches"` can also be set to an array of values, so multiple URL patterns or CSS selectors can be matched simultaneously:

json\`\`\`
{ "where": { "href\_matches": \["/next", "/profile"] } }

\`\`\`
json\`\`\`
{ "where": { "selector\_matches": \[".important\-link", "\#unique\-link"] } }

\`\`\`
URL patterns and selectors can also contain wildcard (`*`) characters, allowing a single value to match multiple URLs. For example, the object below could match `user/`, `user/settings`, `user/stats`, etc.

json\`\`\`
{ "where": { "href\_matches": "/user/\*" } }

\`\`\`
[Search parameters (or query strings)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/search) can also be targeted in `href_matches`. For example, the object below could match all same\-origin URLs with a `category` search parameter (as the first or a subsequent parameter):

json\`\`\`
{ "where": { "href\_matches": "/\*\\\\?\*(^\|\&)category=\*" } }

\`\`\`
Any condition can be negated by placing it inside a `"not"` condition — this means that, when matched, a link *won't* have the speculation rule applied to it, but when *not* matched, it *will*. The following example will cause all links that *don't* match the URL pattern `/logout` to have the rule applied to them, but not links that match `/logout`:

json\`\`\`
{ "where": { "not": { "href\_matches": "/logout" } } }

\`\`\`
#### Combining multiple `"where"` conditions with `"and"` or `"or"`

Multiple conditions can be combined inside `"and"` or `"or"` conditions — these take the value of arrays containing multiple conditions, all or any of which (respectively) have to match for the speculation rules to apply to a link. Using `"and"` or `"or"`, conditions can be nested multiple levels deep — there is no specified limit on allowed nesting levels.

It is useful to think of the `"where"` object as being equivalent to an `if` statement. So

\`\`\`
{ and: \[A, B, { or: \[C, { not: D }] }] }

\`\`\`
is equivalent to

\`\`\`
if (A \&\& B \&\& (C \|\| !D)) {
 apply speculation rule
}

\`\`\`
In the following complete speculation rule example, all same\-origin pages are marked for prefetching except those known to be problematic — the `/logout` page, and any links marked up with a class of `.no-prerender`:

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prefetch": \[
 {
 "where": {
 "and": \[
 { "href\_matches": "/\*" },
 { "not": { "href\_matches": "/logout" } },
 { "not": { "selector\_matches": ".no\-prerender" } }
 ]
 }
 }
 ]
 }
\

\`\`\`

**Note:**
The `where` pattern above does not include cross\-site links, which are supported for prefetching (provided the user has no cookies set for the destination site, to protect against tracking) but not for prerendering.

### [`"relative_to"` example](#relative_to_example)

For rule sets that are externally fetched (i.e. via the [`Speculation-Rules`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Speculation-Rules)) response header, URLs in list rules and URL patterns in document rules are parsed relative to the containing external text file's URL by default. To parse URLs in a list rule relative to the document's base URL, `"relative_to"` is used like this:

json\`\`\`
{
 "urls": \["/home", "/about"],
 "relative\_to": "document"
}

\`\`\`
For document rules, `"relative_to"` can be paired directly with `"href_matches"` and the document's base URL would only be used for patterns in that particular condition:

json\`\`\`
{
 "where": {
 "or": \[
 { "href\_matches": "/home", "relative\_to": "document" },
 { "href\_matches": "/about" }
 ]
 }
}

\`\`\`
In the above example, only the first `"href_matches"` will be matched relative to the document's base URL.

`relative_to` is mainly relevant if the speculation rules JSON file is on a different origin to the document you wish to apply them to:

1. If the document is located at `https://example.com/some/subpage.html` and the rules are at `https://example.com/resources/rules.json`, then `/home` always equates to `https://example.com/home` regardless of whether `relative_to` is set to `document` or `ruleset`.
2. However, if the document is located at `https://example.com/some/subpage.html` and the rules are at `https://other.example/resources/rules.json` (for example, on a third\-party or cookieless resource origin), then:

	* `"relative_to": "document"` will cause `/home` to equate to `https://example.com/home`.
	* `"relative_to": "ruleset"` will cause `/home` to equate to `https://other.example/home`.This is the typical use case for `"relative_to"`.
3. Another potential (but rarer) use case is when your URLs are specified in the form `home` instead of `/home`. If the document is located at `https://example.com/some/subpage.html` and the rules are at `https://example.com/resources/rules.json`, then:

	* `"relative_to": "document"` would cause `home` to equate to `https://example.com/some/home`.
	* `"relative_to": "ruleset"` would cause `home` to equate to `https://example.com/resources/home`.
### [`"expects_no_vary_search"` example](#expects_no_vary_search_example)

Consider the case of a user directory landing page, `/users`, which has an `id` parameter added to bring up information on a specific user, for example `/users?id=345`. Whether this URL should be considered identical for caching purposes depends on the behavior of the application:

1. If this parameter has the effect of loading a completely new page containing the information for the specified user, then the URL should be cached separately.
2. If this parameter has the effect of highlighting the specified user on the same page, and perhaps revealing a pullout panel displaying their data, then the URL should be considered the same for caching purposes. This could result in performance improvements around the loading of the user pages and could be achieved via a [`No-Vary-Search`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/No-Vary-Search) with a value of `params=("id")`.

How does this affect speculation rules? Consider the following code:

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prefetch": \[
 {
 "urls": \["/users"]
 }
 ]
 }
\
\User Bob\

\`\`\`
What would happen in this case when the user starts a navigation to `/users?id=345` when the headers for the prefetch of `/users` have not been received yet? At this point, the browser doesn't know what the `No-Vary-Search` value will be, if anything. If there was no `No-Vary-Search` value set, and the application behavior was more like Option 1 above, the prefetch would be wasted and the browser would need to go and fetch the separate `/users?id=345` page from scratch.

To solve this, we can provide a hint as to what the page author expects the `No-Vary-Search` value to be. A speculation rule can have an `"expects_no_vary_search"` field, which contains a string representation of the expected header value:

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prefetch": \[
 {
 "urls": \["/users"],
 "expects\_no\_vary\_search": "params=(\\"id\\")"
 }
 ]
 }
\
\User Bob\

\`\`\`
This indicates that Option 2 described above is what the server is expected to produce. If a navigation starts while there is an ongoing prefetch of `/users`, this informs the browser that it is appropriate to wait for the prefetch, instead of immediately starting another fetch for `/users?id=345`.

Document rules can also be used in conjunction with `"expects_no_vary_search"`, depending on the pattern used. For example, in the case of:

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prefetch": \[
 {
 { "where": { "href\_matches": "/users?id=\*" } },
 "expects\_no\_vary\_search": "params=(\\"id\\")"
 }
 ]
 }
\
\User Bill\
\User Bob\
\User Ben\

\`\`\`
If a link is hovered over, the browser will start prefetching that specific link.

If the user hovers over another link before the prefetch completes, the `expects_no_vary_search` pattern tells the browser that there is no need to cancel the current prefetch, because all `/users` URLs with `id` URL parameter values effectively point to the same page for this context (and for caching purposes).

### [`eagerness` example](#eagerness_example)

The following set of document rules shows how `eagerness` can be used to hint at the eagerness with which the browser should prerender each matching set of links.

html\`\`\`
\
 {
 "prerender": \[
 {
 "where": { "href\_matches": "/\*" },
 "eagerness": "conservative"
 },
 {
 "where": { "selector\_matches": ".product\-link" },
 "eagerness": "eager"
 }
 ]
 }
\

\`\`\`
Here we are hinting that:

* All same\-site links contained in the document should be conservatively prerendered (i.e. when the user starts to activate them).
* Any product links (in this case, those with a `class` of `.product-link`) in the document should be eagerly prerendered (i.e. if the user makes any kind of move towards navigating to them).

**Note:**
The effects of eagerness settings are less useful for list rules. By default, list rule URLs are prefetched/prerendered immediately as soon as the rules are parsed, which is what you'd expect — they are intended for explicit listing of high\-priority URLs that you want to make available as soon as possible. For this reason, `eager` has the same effect as `immediate` in current implementations. Lower eagerness settings are for prefetching/prerendering when links are interacted with, and for these you are more likely to use document rules to find them on the page.

## <search>: The generic search element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/search)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a container representing the parts of the document or application with form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation. The `` element semantically identifies the purpose of the element's contents as having search or filtering capabilities. The search or filtering functionality can be for the website or application, the current web page or document, or the entire Internet or subsection thereof.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element is not for presenting search results. Rather, search or filtered results should be presented as part of the main content of that web page. That said, suggestions and links that are part of "quick search" functionality within the search or filtering functionality are appropriately nested within the contents of the `` element as they are search features.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The `` element defines a [`search`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/search_role) landmark. This removes the need for adding `role=search` to a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Header search form](#header_search_form)

This example demonstrates the use of `` as the container for a search within a website header to perform a simple site\-wide search. The `` is a semantic container for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) that submits the user\-entered search query to a server.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 \Movie website\
 \
 \
 \Find a Movie\
 \
 \Search\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Web app search](#web_app_search)

This example demonstrates potential DOM content when dynamically including JavaScript search functionality in a web application. When search functionality is implemented entirely with JavaScript, if no form is submitted, neither a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element nor a submit [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) is required. For semantics, the `` element is included to contain the search and filtering capabilities.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 Find and filter your query
 \
 \
 \
 \
 Exact matches only
 \

 \
 \Results:\
 \
 \
 \
 \
 \

\

\`\`\`
#### Result

**Note:**
Remember that some users don't have JavaScript, and none of your users have JavaScript running until the JavaScript is successfully downloaded, parsed, and executed. Ensure your users can access the content of your site with JavaScript disabled.

### [Multiple searches](#multiple_searches)

This example demonstrates a page with two search features. The first is a global site search located on the header. The second is a search and filter based on the page context, in our example a car search.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \Car rental agency\

## <section>: The Generic Section element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

As mentioned above, `` is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it. As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) element, but a list of search results or a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a ``.

Also consider these cases:

* If the contents of the element represent a standalone, atomic unit of content that makes sense syndicated as a standalone piece (e.g. a blog post or blog comment, or a newspaper article), the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) element would be a better choice.
* If the contents represent useful tangential information that works alongside the main content, but is not directly part of it (like related links, or an author bio), use an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside).
* If the contents represent the main content area of a document, use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main).
* If you are only using the element as a styling wrapper, use a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) instead.

To reiterate, each `` should be identified, typically by including a heading ([h1](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) \- [h6](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) element) as a child of the `` element, wherever possible. See below for examples of where you might see a `` without a heading.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic usage example](#basic_usage_example)

#### Before

html\`\`\`
\
 \Heading\
 \Bunch of awesome content\
\

\`\`\`
##### Result

#### After

html\`\`\`
\
 \Heading\
 \Bunch of awesome content\
\

\`\`\`
##### Result

### [Using a section without a heading](#using_a_section_without_a_heading)

Circumstances where you might see `` used without a heading are typically found in web application/UI sections rather than in traditional document structures. In a document, it doesn't really make any sense to have a separate section of content without a heading to describe its contents. Such headings are useful for all readers, but particularly useful for users of assistive technologies like screen readers, and they are also good for SEO.

Consider however a secondary navigation mechanism. If the global navigation is already wrapped in a `` element, you could conceivably wrap a previous/next menu in a ``:

html\`\`\`
\
 \Previous article\
 \Next article\
\

\`\`\`
Or what about some kind of button bar for controlling your app? This might not necessarily want a heading, but it is still a distinct section of the document:

html\`\`\`
\
 \Reply\
 \Reply to all\
 \Forward\
 \Delete\
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

Depending on the content, including a heading could also be good for SEO, so it is an option to consider.

## <select>: The HTML Select element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a control that provides a menu of options.

## [Try it](#try_it)

The above example shows typical `` usage. It is given an `id` attribute to enable it to be associated with a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) for accessibility purposes, as well as a `name` attribute to represent the name of the associated data point submitted to the server. Each menu option is defined by an [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) element nested inside the ``.

Each `` element should have a [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option#value) attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected. If no `value` attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a [`selected`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option#selected) attribute on an `` element to make it selected by default when the page first loads. If no `selected` attribute is specified, the first `` element will be selected by default.

A `` element is represented in JavaScript by an [`HTMLSelectElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement) object, and this object has a [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSelectElement/value "value") property which contains the value of the selected ``.

The `` element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as `multiple` to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and `size` to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as `required`, `disabled`, `autofocus`, etc.

You can further nest [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) elements inside [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup) elements to create separate groups of options inside the dropdown. You can also include [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) elements to create separators that add visual breaks between options.

For further examples, see [The native form widgets: Drop\-down content](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Other_form_controls#drop-down_controls).

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)

A string providing a hint for a [user agent's](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) autocomplete feature. See [The HTML autocomplete attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) for a complete list of values and details on how to use autocomplete.

[`autofocus`](#autofocus)

This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should have input focus when the page loads. Only one form element in a document can have the `autofocus` attribute.

[`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)

This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot interact with the control. If this attribute is not specified, the control inherits its setting from the containing element, for example [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset); if there is no containing element with the `disabled` attribute set, then the control is enabled.

[`form`](#form)

The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element to associate the `` with (its *form owner*). The value of this attribute must be the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) of a `` in the same document. (If this attribute is not set, the `` is associated with its ancestor `` element, if any.)

This attribute lets you associate `` elements to ``s anywhere in the document, not just inside a ``. It can also override an ancestor `` element.

[`multiple`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/multiple)

This Boolean attribute indicates that multiple options can be selected in the list. If it is not specified, then only one option can be selected at a time. When `multiple` is specified, most browsers will show a scrolling list box instead of a single line dropdown.

[`name`](#name)

This attribute is used to specify the name of the control.

[`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required)

A Boolean attribute indicating that an option with a non\-empty string value must be selected.

[`size`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/size)

If the control is presented as a scrolling list box (e.g. when `multiple` is specified), this attribute represents the number of rows in the list that should be visible at one time. Browsers are not required to present a select element as a scrolled list box. The default value is `0`.

**Note:**
According to the HTML specification, the default value for size should be `1`; however, in practice, this has been found to break some websites, and no other browser currently does that, so Mozilla has opted to continue to return `0` for the time being with Firefox.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

### [Selecting multiple options](#selecting_multiple_options)

On a desktop computer, there are a number of ways to select multiple options in a `` element with a `multiple` attribute:

Mouse users can hold the `Ctrl`, `Command`, or `Shift` keys (depending on what makes sense for your operating system) and then click multiple options to select/deselect them.

**Warning:**
The mechanism for selecting multiple non\-contiguous items via the keyboard described below currently only seems to work in Firefox.

On macOS, the `Ctrl` \+ `Up` and `Ctrl` \+ `Down` shortcuts conflict with the OS default shortcuts for *Mission Control* and *Application windows*, so you'll have to turn these off before it will work.

Keyboard users can select multiple contiguous items by:

* Focusing on the `` element (e.g. using `Tab`).
* Selecting an item at the top or bottom of the range they want to select using the `Up` and `Down` cursor keys to go up and down the options.
* Holding down the `Shift` key and then using the `Up` and `Down` cursor keys to increase or decrease the range of items selected.

Keyboard users can select multiple non\-contiguous items by:

* Focusing on the `` element (e.g. using `Tab`).
* Holding down the `Ctrl` key then using the `Up` and `Down` cursor keys to change the "focused" select option, i.e. the one that will be selected if you choose to do so. The "focused" select option is highlighted with a dotted outline, in the same way as a keyboard\-focused link.
* Pressing `Space` to select/deselect "focused" select options.
## [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

The `` element is notoriously difficult to style productively with CSS. You can affect certain aspects like any element — for example, manipulating the [box model](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model), the [displayed font](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts), etc., and you can use the [`appearance`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/appearance) property to remove the default system `appearance`.

However, these properties don't produce a consistent result across browsers, and it is hard to do things like line different types of form element up with one another in a column. The `` element's internal structure is complex, and hard to control. If you want to get full control, you should consider using a library with good facilities for styling form widgets, or try rolling your own dropdown menu using non\-semantic elements, JavaScript, and [WAI\-ARIA](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics) to provide semantics.

For more useful information on styling ``, see:

* [Styling HTML forms](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Styling_web_forms)
* [Advanced styling for HTML forms](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Advanced_form_styling)
* The [`field-sizing`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/field-sizing) property, which controls how `` elements are sized in relation to their contained options.
## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

The `` within a `` should be considered purely decorative, as they are currently not exposed within the accessibility tree and therefore not exposed to assistive technologies.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic select](#basic_select)

The following example creates a three\-value dropdown menu, the second option of which is selected by default.

\
\
 \First Value\

### [Select with grouping options](#select_with_grouping_options)

The following example creates a dropdown menu with grouping using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) to make it easier for the user to understand the content in the dropdown.

\`\`\`
#### Result

You'll see that:

* Multiple options are selectable because we've included the `multiple` attribute.
* The `size` attribute causes only 4 lines to display at a time; you can scroll to view all the options.
* We've included [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/optgroup) elements to divide the options up into different groups. This is a purely visual grouping, its visualization generally consists of the group name being bolded, and the options being indented.
* The "Hamster" option includes a `disabled` attribute and therefore can't be selected at all.

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element—part of the [Web Components](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) technology suite—is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`name`](#name)

The slot's name.

A ***named slot*** is a `` element with a `name` attribute.

## [Notes](#notes)

Although the `` element, like the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i) elements, may be perceived to violate the principle of separation between structure and presentation, all three are valid in HTML. Authors are encouraged to use their best judgement when determining whether to use `` or CSS.

## <source>: The Media or Image Source element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies one or more media resources for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) elements. It is a [void element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element), which means that it has no content and does not require a closing tag. This element is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for [image file formats](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) and [media file formats](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element supports all [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes). In addition, the following attributes can be used with it:

[`type`](#type)

Specifies the [MIME media type of the image](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) or [other media type](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers), optionally including a [`codecs` parameter](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/codecs_parameter).

[`src`](#src)

Specifies the URL of the media resource. Required if the parent of `` is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video). Not allowed if the parent is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture).

[`srcset`](#srcset)

Specifies a comma\-separated list of one or more image URLs and their descriptors. Required if the parent of `` is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture). Not allowed if the parent is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).

The list consists of strings separated by commas, indicating a set of possible images for the browser to use. Each string is composed of:

* A URL specifying an image location.
* An optional width descriptor—a positive integer directly followed by `"w"`, such as `300w`.
* An optional pixel density descriptor—a positive floating number directly followed by `"x"`, such as `2x`.

Each string in the list must have either a width descriptor or a pixel density descriptor to be valid. These two descriptors should not be used together; only one should be used consistently throughout the list. The value of each descriptor in the list must be unique. The browser chooses the most adequate image to display at a given point of time based on these descriptors. If the descriptors are not specified, the default value used is `1x`. If the `sizes` attribute is also present, then each string must include a width descriptor. If the browser does not support `srcset`, then `src` will be used for the default image source.

[`sizes`](#sizes)

Specifies a list of source sizes that describe the final rendered width of the image. Allowed if the parent of `` is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture). Not allowed if the parent is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).

The list consists of source sizes separated by commas. Each source size is media condition\-length pair. Before laying the page out, the browser uses this information to determine which image defined in [`srcset`](#srcset) to display. Note that `sizes` will take effect only if width descriptors are provided with `srcset`, not pixel density descriptors (i.e., `200w` should be used instead of `2x`).

[`media`](#media)

Specifies the [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries) for the resource's intended media.

[`height`](#height)

Specifies the intrinsic height of the image in pixels. Allowed if the parent of `` is a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture). Not allowed if the parent is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).

The height value must be an integer without any units.

[`width`](#width)

Specifies the intrinsic width of the image in pixels. Allowed if the parent of `` is a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture). Not allowed if the parent is [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).

The width value must be an integer without any units.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element is a **[void element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element)**, which means that it not only has no content but also has no closing tag. That is, you *never* use `` in your HTML.

The browser goes through a list of `` elements to find a format it supports. It uses the first one it can display. For each `` element:

* If the `type` attribute isn't specified, the browser retrieves the media's type from the server and determines if it can be displayed. If the media can't be rendered, the browser checks the next `` in the list.
* If the `type` attribute is specified, the browser immediately compares it with the media types it can display. If the type is not supported, the browser skips querying the server and directly checks the next `` element.

If none of the `` elements provide a usable source:

* In the case of a `` element, the browser will fall back to using the image specified in the `` element's [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) child.
* In the case of an `` or `` element, the browser will fall back to displaying the content included between the element's opening and closing tags.

For information about image formats supported by web browsers and guidance on selecting appropriate formats to use, see our [Image file type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types). For details on the video and audio media types you can use, see the [Media type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats).

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Using the `type` attribute with ``](#using_the_type_attribute_with_video)

This example demonstrates how to offer a video in different formats: WebM for browsers that support it, Ogg for those that support Ogg, and QuickTime for browsers that support QuickTime. If the `` or `` element is not supported by the browser, a notice is displayed instead. If the browser supports the element but does not support any of the specified formats, an `error` event is raised and the default media controls (if enabled) will indicate an error. For more details on which media file formats to use and their browser support, refer to our [Media type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats).

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \
 I'm sorry; your browser doesn't support HTML video.
\

\`\`\`### [Using the `media` attribute with ``](#using_the_media_attribute_with_video)

This example demonstrates how to offer an alternate source file for viewports above a certain width. When a user's browsing environment meets the specified `media` condition, the associated `` element is chosen. The contents of its `src` attribute are then requested and rendered. If the `media` condition does not match, the browser will move on to the next `` in the list. The second `` option in the code below has no `media` condition, so it will be selected for all other browsing contexts.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 I'm sorry; your browser doesn't support HTML video.
\

\`\`\`
For more examples, the [HTML video and audio](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_video_and_audio) article in the Learn area is a great resource.

### [Using the `media` attribute with ``](#using_the_media_attribute_with_picture)

In this example, two `` elements are included within [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture), providing versions of an image to use when the available space exceeds certain widths. If the available width is less than the smallest of these widths, the browser will fall back to the image specified in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
With the `` element, you must always include an `` with a fallback image. Also, make sure to add an `alt` attribute for accessibility, unless the image is purely decorative and irrelevant to the content.

### [Using `height` and `width` attributes with ``](#using_height_and_width_attributes_with_picture)

In this example, three `` elements with `height` and `width` attributes are included in a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element.
A [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) allows the browser to select an image to display with the `height` and `width` attributes based on the [viewport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport) size.

## <span>: The Content Span element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) or [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as [`lang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang). It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. `` is very much like a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) element, but [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) is a [block\-level element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content) whereas a `` is an [inline\-level element](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content).

## <strike> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strike)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.

**Warning:**
This element is deprecated in HTML 4 and XHTML 1, and obsoleted in the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/obsolete.html#strike). If semantically appropriate, i.e., if it represents *deleted* content, use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del) instead. In all other cases use [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s).

## <strong>: The Strong Importance element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element is for content that is of "strong importance," including things of great seriousness or urgency (such as warnings). This could be a sentence that is of great importance to the whole page, or you could merely try to point out that some words are of greater importance compared to nearby content.

Typically this element is rendered by default using a bold font weight. However, it should *not* be used to apply bold styling; use the CSS [`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) property for that purpose. Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b) element to draw attention to certain text without indicating a higher level of importance. Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) element to mark text that has stress emphasis.

Another accepted use for `` is to denote the labels of paragraphs which represent notes or warnings within the text of a page.

### [\ vs. \](#b_vs._strong)

It is often confusing to new developers why there are so many ways to express the same thing on a rendered website. [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b) and `` are perhaps one of the most common sources of confusion, causing developers to ask "Should I use `` or ``? Don't they both do the same thing?"

Not exactly. The `` element is for content that is of greater importance, while the `` element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more important.

It may help to realize that both are valid and semantic elements in HTML and that it's a coincidence that they both have the same default styling (boldface) in most browsers (although some older browsers actually underline ``). Each element is meant to be used in certain types of scenarios, and if you want to bold text for decoration, you should instead actually use the CSS [`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) property.

The intended meaning or purpose of the enclosed text should be what determines which element you use. Communicating meaning is what semantics are all about.

### [\ vs. \](#em_vs._strong)

Adding to the confusion is the fact that while HTML 4 defined `` as indicating a stronger emphasis, HTML 5 defines `` as representing "strong importance for its contents." This is an important distinction to make.

While `` is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I *love* carrots" vs. "I love *carrots*"), `` is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "**Warning!** This is **very dangerous.**") Both `` and `` can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.

## <style>: The Style Information element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element contains style information for a document, or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing the `` element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

The `` element must be included inside the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) of the document. In general, it is better to put your styles in external stylesheets and apply them using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) elements.

If you include multiple `` and `` elements in your document, they will be applied to the DOM in the order they are included in the document — make sure you include them in the correct order, to avoid unexpected cascade issues.

In the same manner as `` elements, `` elements can include `media` attributes that contain [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries), allowing you to selectively apply internal stylesheets to your document depending on media features such as viewport width.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

This attribute explicitly indicates that certain operations should be blocked on the fetching of critical subresources. [`@import`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import)\-ed stylesheets are generally considered as critical subresources, whereas [`background-image`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) and fonts are not. The operations that are to be blocked must be a space\-separated list of blocking tokens listed below.

* `render`: The rendering of content on the screen is blocked.

[`media`](#media)

This attribute defines which media the style should be applied to. Its value is a [media query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries), which defaults to `all` if the attribute is missing.

[`nonce`](#nonce)

A cryptographic nonce (number used once) used to allow inline styles in a [style\-src Content\-Security\-Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src). The server must generate a unique nonce value each time it transmits a policy. It is critical to provide a nonce that cannot be guessed as bypassing a resource's policy is otherwise trivial.

[`title`](#title)

This attribute specifies [alternative style sheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Alternative_style_sheets) sets.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

[`type` 
Deprecated](#type)

This attribute should not be provided: if it is, the only permitted values are the empty string or a case\-insensitive match for `text/css`.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [A basic stylesheet](#a_basic_stylesheet)

In the following example, we apply a short stylesheet to a document:

html\`\`\`
\
\
 \
 \
 \Test page\
 \
 p {
 color: red;
 }
 \
 \
 \
 \This is my paragraph.\
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Multiple style elements](#multiple_style_elements)

In this example we've included two `` elements — notice how the conflicting declarations in the later `` element override those in the earlier one, if they have equal [specificity](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity).

html\`\`\`
\
\
 \
 \
 \Test page\
 \
 p {
 color: white;
 background\-color: blue;
 padding: 5px;
 border: 1px solid black;
 }
 \
 \
 p {
 color: blue;
 background\-color: yellow;
 }
 \
 \
 \
 \This is my paragraph.\
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Including a media query](#including_a_media_query)

In this example we build on the previous one, including a `media` attribute on the second `` element so it is only applied when the viewport is less than 500px in width.

html\`\`\`
\
\
 \
 \
 \Test page\
 \
 p {
 color: white;
 background\-color: blue;
 padding: 5px;
 border: 1px solid black;
 }
 \
 \
 p {
 color: blue;
 background\-color: yellow;
 }
 \
 \
 \
 \This is my paragraph.\

## <sub>: The Subscript element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sub)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element should be used only for typographical reasons—that is, to change the position of the text to comply with typographical conventions or standards, rather than solely for presentation or appearance purposes.

For example, using `` to style the name of a company which uses altered baselines in their [wordmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordmark) would not be appropriate; instead, CSS should be used. For example, you could use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) property with a declaration like `vertical-align: sub` or, to more precisely control the baseline shift, `vertical-align: -25%`.

Appropriate use cases for `` include (but aren't necessarily limited to):

* Marking up footnote numbers. See [Footnote numbers](#footnote_numbers) for an example.
* Marking up the subscript in mathematical variable numbers (although you may also consider using a [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) formula for this). See [Variable subscripts](#variable_subscripts).
* Denoting the number of atoms of a given element within a chemical formula (such as every developer's best friend, C8H10N4O2, otherwise known as "caffeine"). See [Chemical formulas](#chemical_formulas).
## [Examples](#examples)

### [Footnote numbers](#footnote_numbers)

Traditional footnotes are denoted using numbers which are rendered in subscript. This is a common use case for ``:

html\`\`\`
\
 According to the computations by Nakamura, Johnson, and Mason\1\ this
 will result in the complete annihilation of both particles.
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Variable subscripts](#variable_subscripts)

In mathematics, families of variables related to the same concept (such as distances along the same axis) are represented using the same variable name with a subscript following. For example:

html\`\`\`
\
 The horizontal coordinates' positions along the X\-axis are represented as
 \x\1\\ … \x\n\\.
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Chemical formulas](#chemical_formulas)

When writing a chemical formula, such as H20, the number of atoms of a given element within the described molecule is represented using a subscripted number; in the case of water, the subscripted "2" indicates that there are two atoms of hydrogen in the molecule.

Another example:

html\`\`\`
\
 Almost every developer's favorite molecule is
 C\8\H\10\N\4\O\2\, which is commonly known
 as "caffeine."

## <summary>: The Disclosure Summary element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element's disclosure box. Clicking the `` element toggles the state of the parent `` element open and closed.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element's contents can be any heading content, plain text, or HTML that can be used within a paragraph.

A `` element may *only* be used as the first child of a `` element. When the user clicks on the summary, the parent `` element is toggled open or closed, and then a [`toggle`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/toggle_event "toggle") event is sent to the `` element, which can be used to let you know when this state change occurs.

The content of the `` provides the [accessible description](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_description) for the ``.

### [Default label text](#default_label_text)

If a `` element's first child is not a `` element, the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) will use a default string (typically "Details") as the label for the disclosure box.

### [Default style](#default_style)

Per the HTML specification, the default style for `` elements includes `display: list-item`. This makes it possible to change or remove the icon displayed as the disclosure widget next to the label from the default, which is typically a triangle.

You can also change the style to `display: block` to remove the disclosure triangle.

See the [Browser compatibility](#browser_compatibility) section for details, as not all browsers support full functionality of this element yet.

For WebKit\-based browsers, such as Safari, it is possible to control the icon display through the non\-standard CSS pseudo\-element `::-webkit-details-marker`. To remove the disclosure triangle, use `summary::-webkit-details-marker { display: none }`.

## [Examples](#examples)

Below are some examples showing `` in use. You can find more examples in the documentation for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element.

### [Basic example](#basic_example)

A basic example showing the use of `` in a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element:

html\`\`\`
\
 \Overview\
 \
 \Cash on hand: $500\.00\
 \Current invoice: $75\.30\
 \Due date: 5/6/19\
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Summaries as headings](#summaries_as_headings)

You can use heading elements in ``, like this:

html\`\`\`
\
 \\Overview\\
 \
 \Cash on hand: $500\.00\
 \Current invoice: $75\.30\
 \Due date: 5/6/19\
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

This currently has some spacing issues that could be addressed using CSS.

**Warning:**
Because the `` element has a default role of [button](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role) (which strips all roles from child elements), this example will not work for users of assistive technologies such as screen readers. The `` will have its role removed and thus will not be treated as a heading for these users.

### [HTML in summaries](#html_in_summaries)

This example adds some semantics to the `` element to indicate the label as important:

html\`\`\`
\
 \\Overview\\
 \
 \Cash on hand: $500\.00\
 \Current invoice: $75\.30\
 \Due date: 5/6/19\
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Changing the summary's icon](#changing_the_summarys_icon)

The `` element's marker, the disclosure triangle, can be customized with CSS. The marker can be targeted using the [`::marker`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) pseudo\-element. which accepts the [`list-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style) shorthand property and its longhand component properties, such as [`list-style-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type). This enables changing the triangle to an image (usually with [`list-style-image`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-image)) or a string (including emojis). In this example, we replace the content of one disclosure widget and remove the icon from another by setting `list-style: none` before adding a custom disclosure icon via generated content.

#### CSS

In the first disclosure widget, we style the `::marker`, changing the [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) based on the `` element's `[open]` attribute. For the second widget, we remove the marker with `list-style` properties, then add styled generated content with the [`::after`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo\-element. We also include styles for `::-webkit-details-marker` to target Safari. The selector for the browser\-specific pseudo\-element is included in an [`:is()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is) pseudo\-class so it doesn't invalidate the selector list.

css\`\`\`
details {
 font\-size: 1rem;
 font\-family: "Open Sans", Calibri, sans\-serif;
 border: solid;
 padding: 2px 6px;
 margin\-bottom: 1em;
}

details:first\-of\-type summary::marker,
:is(::\-webkit\-details\-marker) {
 content: "\+ ";
 font\-family: monospace;
 color: red;
 font\-weight: bold;
}

details\[open]:first\-of\-type summary::marker {
 content: "\- ";
}

details:last\-of\-type summary {
 list\-style: none;
 \&::after {
 content: "\+";
 color: white;
 background\-color: darkgreen;
 border\-radius: 1em;
 font\-weight: bold;
 padding: 0 5px;
 margin\-inline\-start: 5px;
 }
 \[open] \&::after {
 content: "\-";
 }
}
details:last\-of\-type summary::\-webkit\-details\-marker {
 display: none;
}

\`\`\`
The CSS includes the `[open]` [attribute selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors), matching only when the `open` attribute is present (when the `` are open). The [`:first-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-of-type) and [`:last-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-of-type) pseudo\-classes target the first and sibling elements of the same type. We included the prefixed `-webkit-` pseudo\-element within a [`:is()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is) pseudo\-class as it takes a [forgiving selector list](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list#forgiving_selector_list), so if the prefixed pseudo\-element is invalid in a browser, the whole selector block will not be invalid. We also used CSS [nesting](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector). See the [CSS selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors) module.

## <sup>: The Superscript element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sup)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element should only be used for typographical reasons—that is, to change the position of the text to comply with typographical conventions or standards, rather than solely for presentation or appearance purposes.

For example, to style the [wordmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordmark) of a business or product which uses a raised baseline should be done using CSS (most likely [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align)) rather than ``. This would be done using, for example, `vertical-align: super` or, to shift the baseline up 50%, `vertical-align: 50%`.

Appropriate use cases for `` include (but aren't necessarily limited to):

* Displaying exponents, such as "x3". It may be worth considering the use of [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) for these, especially in more complex cases. See [Exponents](#exponents) under [Examples](#examples) below.
* Displaying [superior lettering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_letter), which is used in some languages when rendering certain abbreviations. For example, in French, the word "mademoiselle" can be abbreviated "Mlle"; this is an acceptable use case. See [Superior lettering](#superior_lettering) for examples.
* Representing ordinal numbers, such as "4th" instead of "fourth." See [Ordinal numbers](#ordinal_numbers) for examples.
## [Examples](#examples)

### [Exponents](#exponents)

Exponents, or powers of a number, are among the most common uses of superscripted text. For example:

html\`\`\`
\
 One of the most common equations in all of physics is \E\=\m\\c\\2\.
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Superior lettering](#superior_lettering)

Superior lettering is not technically the same thing as superscript. However, it is common to use `` to present superior lettering in HTML. Among the most common uses of superior lettering is the presentation of certain abbreviations in French:

html\`\`\`
\Robert a présenté son rapport à M\lle\ Bernard.\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Ordinal numbers](#ordinal_numbers)

Ordinal numbers, such as "fourth" in English or "quinto" in Spanish may be abbreviated using numerals and language\-specific text rendered in superscript:

html\`\`\`
\
 The ordinal number "fifth" can be abbreviated in various languages as follows:
\
\
 \English: 5\th\\
 \French: 5\ème\\

## <table>: The Table element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents tabular data—that is, information presented in a two\-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of the table within its parent element. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, and `right`. Use the [`margin-inline-start`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-inline-start) and [`margin-inline-end`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-inline-end) CSS properties instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of the table. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`border` 
Deprecated](#border)

Defines, as a non\-negative integer value (in pixels), the size of the frame surrounding the table. If set to `0`, the [`frame`](#frame) attribute is set to void. Use the [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`cellpadding` 
Deprecated](#cellpadding)

Defines the space between the content of a cell and its border. This attribute is obsolete: instead of using it, apply the [`padding`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) CSS property to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements.

[`cellspacing` 
Deprecated](#cellspacing)

Defines the size of the space between two cells. This attribute is obsolete: instead of using it, set the [`border-spacing`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-spacing) CSS property on the `` element. Note that this has no effect if the `` element's [`border-collapse`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-collapse) CSS property is set to `collapse`.

[`frame` 
Deprecated](#frame)

Defines which side of the frame surrounding the table must be displayed. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `void`, `above`, `below`, `hsides`, `vsides`, `lhs`, `rhs`, `box` and `border`. Use the [`border-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style) and [`border-width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width) CSS properties instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`rules` 
Deprecated](#rules)

Defines where rules (borders) are displayed in the table. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `none` (default value), `groups` ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) elements), `rows` (horizontal lines), `cols` (vertical lines), and `all` (border around every cell). Use the [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) CSS property on the appropriate table\-related elements, as well as on the `` itself, instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`summary` 
Deprecated](#summary)

Defines an alternative text that summarizes the content of the table. Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) element instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`width` 
Deprecated](#width)

Specifies the width of the table. Use the [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

**Note:**
While no HTML specification includes `height` as a `` attribute, some browsers support a non\-standard interpretation of `height`. The unitless value sets a minimum absolute height in pixels. If set as a percent value, the minimum table height will be relative to the parent container's height. Use the [`min-height`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-height) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Visual layout of table contents](#visual_layout_of_table_contents)

Following elements are part of the table structure:

* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot)

The `` box establishes a table formatting context. Elements inside the `` generate rectangular boxes. Each box occupies a number of table cells according to the following rules:

1. The row boxes fill the table in the source code order from top to bottom. Each row box occupies one row of cells.
2. A row group box occupies one or more row boxes.
3. Column boxes are placed next to each other in source code order. Depending on the value of the [`dir`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir) attribute, the columns are laid in left\-to\-right or right\-to\-left direction. A column box occupies one or more columns of table cells.
4. A column group box occupies one or more column boxes.
5. A cell box may span over multiple rows and columns. User agents trim cells to fit in the available number of rows and columns.

Table cells do have padding. Boxes that make up a table do not have margins.

### [Table layers and transparency](#table_layers_and_transparency)

For styling purpose the table elements may be thought of as being put on six superimposed layers:



The background set on an element in one layer will be visible only if the layers above it have transparent background. A missing cell is rendered as if an anonymous table\-cell box occupied that place.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

### [Captions](#captions)

By supplying a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) element whose value clearly and concisely describes the table's purpose, it helps the people decide if they need to check the rest of the table content or skip over it.

This helps people navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen reader, people experiencing low vision conditions, and people with cognitive concerns.

### [Scoping rows and columns](#scoping_rows_and_columns)

The [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) attribute on header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements) is redundant in simple contexts, because scope is inferred. However, some assistive technologies may fail to draw correct inferences, so specifying header scope may improve user experiences. In complex tables, [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) can be specified to provide necessary information about the cells related to a header.

### [Complicated tables](#complicated_tables)

Assistive technologies such as screen readers may have difficulty parsing tables that are so complex that header cells can't be associated in a strictly horizontal or vertical way. This is typically indicated by the presence of the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) and [`rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#rowspan) attributes.

Ideally, consider alternate ways to present the table's content, including breaking it apart into a collection of smaller, related tables that don't have to rely on using the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) and [`rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#rowspan) attributes. In addition to helping people who use assistive technology understand the table's content, this may also benefit people with cognitive concerns who may have difficulty understanding the associations the table layout is describing.

If the table cannot be broken apart, use a combination of the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) and [`headers`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#headers) attributes to programmatically associate each table cell with the header(s) ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements) the cell is associated with.

## [Examples](#examples)

The examples below include tables of progressively increasing complexity. See also our beginner's [Styling tables](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Tables) guide for table styling information including common, useful techniques.

Since the structure of a `` involves the use of several table\-related HTML elements along with various associated attributes, the following examples are intended to provide a simplified explanation that covers the basics and common standards. Additional and more detailed information can be found on the corresponding linked pages.

These table examples demonstrate how to create an [accessible](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility) table that is structured with HTML and styled with [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

Because of how HTML tables are structured, the [markup](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Markup) can quickly grow. For this reason, it is important to clearly define the table's purpose and final appearance to create the appropriate structure. A logical structure developed with [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) markup is not only easier to style, but enables useful and accessible tables that can be understood and navigated by everyone, including search engines and users of assistive technologies.

The first example is basic, with subsequent examples growing in complexity. First, we will develop a very basic HTML table structure for the table. The first two examples contain no table section groups such as a defined head, body, or foot, and involve no cell spanning or explicitly defined cell relationships. Not even a caption is provided. As we work through the examples, they will be progressively enhanced to include all the table features that a complex data table should possess.

### [Basic table](#basic_table)

This example includes a *very* basic table with three rows and two columns. To demonstrate default browser table styles, no CSS has been included in this example.

#### HTML

The table rows are defined with [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements, and the columns are defined with table header and data cells within them. The first row contains the header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements) that serve as column headers for the data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements). Each element ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)) per row is in its respective column—that is, the first element of a row is in the first column, and the second element of that row is in the second column.

\

\`\`\`
#### Result

There is no custom [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) or [user stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade#author_stylesheets) applied to this table. The styling results purely from the [user\-agent stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade#user-agent_stylesheets).

### [Expanded table with header cells](#expanded_table_with_header_cells)

This example extends the [basic table](#basic_table), extending the content and adding basic CSS styles.

#### HTML

The table comprises four rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements) now, with four columns each. The first row is a row of header cells (The first row contains only [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements). Subsequent rows include a header column ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements as the first child elements of each row) and three data columns ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements). As table sectioning elements are not used, the browser automatically defines the content group structure, i.e., all rows are wrapped within the body of the table of an implicit [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) element.

\`\`\`
#### CSS

With CSS, we provide the basic styling to create lines around the components of the table to make the data structure clearer. The CSS adds a solid border around the `` and around each of the table's cells, including those specified with both [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements, demarcating every header and data cells.

css\`\`\`
table {
 border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140\);
}

th,
td {
 border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160\);
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Specifying table cell relations](#specifying_table_cell_relations)

Before moving on to extend the table in more advanced ways, it's advisable to improve [accessibility](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility) by defining relationships between the header and data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements).

#### HTML

This is accomplished by introducing the [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) attribute on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements and setting the values to the corresponding `col` (column) or `row` value.

 \
\

\`\`\`
The CSS and visual result are unchanged—the adaptation provides valuable contextual information for assistive technologies such as screen readers to help identify which cells the headers relate to.

**Note:**
If the table structure is even more complex, the (additional) use of the [`headers`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#headers) attribute on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements may improve accessibility and help assistive technologies identify the relationships between cells; see [Complicated tables](#complicated_tables).

### [Explicitly specifying table section groups](#explicitly_specifying_table_section_groups)

In addition to improving accessibility by [specifying cell relations](#specifying_table_cell_relations), the [semantics](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) of the table can be improved by introducing table section groups.

#### HTML

Since the first row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element) contains only column header cells and provides the header for the rest of the table's contents, it can be enclosed in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) element to explicitly specify that row as the head section of the table. Moreover, what is automatically accomplished by the browser can also be defined explicitly—the body section of the table, which contains the main data of the table, is specified by enclosing the corresponding rows in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) element. The explicit use of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) element helps the browser to create the intended table structure, avoiding unwanted results.

\`\`\`
Once again, the CSS and visual result are unchanged—specifying such table section groups provides valuable contextual information for assistive technologies, including screen readers and search engines, as well as for styling in the CSS, which will be shown in a later example.

### [Column and row spanning](#column_and_row_spanning)

In this example, we extend the table even more by adding a column and introducing a multi\-row head section.

#### HTML

Building on the table created so far, a new column for a "Membership End Date" is added in each body row with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) element. An additional row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element) is also added within the head section ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) element) to introduce a "Membership Dates" header as a heading for the "Joined" and "Canceled" columns.

The creation of the second header row involves adding [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#colspan) and [`rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#rowspan) attributes to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements to allocate the header cells to the correct columns and rows.

table {

}

th,
td {
 border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160\);
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

The head section now has two rows, one with the headers ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements) "Name", "ID", "Membership Dates", and "Balance", and a "Membership Dates" header with two subheaders that are in a second row: "Joined" and "Canceled". This is accomplished by:

* The first row's "Name", "ID", and "Balance" header cells span both table header rows by using the [`rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#rowspan) attribute, making them each two rows tall.
* The first row's "Membership Dates" header cell spans two columns using the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#colspan) attribute, causing it to be two columns wide.
* The second row contains only the two header cells "Joined" and "Canceled" because the other three columns are merged with the cells in the first row that span two rows. The two header cells are correctly positioned under the "Membership Dates" header.
### [Table caption and column summary](#table_caption_and_column_summary)

It's a common and advisable practice to provide a summary for the table's content, allowing users to quickly determine the table's relevance. Furthermore, the "Balance" column is summarized by displaying the sum of the balances of the individual members.

#### HTML

A table summary is added by using a table [caption](#captions) ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) element) as the first child element of the ``. The caption provides the [accessible description](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessible_description) for the table.

Lastly, a table foot section ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) element) is added below the body, with a row that summarizes the "Balance" column by displaying a sum. The elements and attributes introduced earlier are applied.

### [Basic table styling](#basic_table_styling)

Let's apply a basic style to the table to adjust the typeface and add a [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) to the head and foot rows. The HTML is unchanged this time, so let's dive right into the CSS.

#### CSS

While a [`font`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) property is added to the `` element here to set a more visually appealing typeface (or an abominable sans\-serif typeface, depending on your personal opinion), the interesting part is the second style, where the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements located within the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) are styled adding a light blue [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color). This is a way to quickly apply a background color to all the cells in specific sections simultaneously.

css\`\`\`
table {
 border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140\);
 font:
 16px "Open Sans",

### [Advanced table styling](#advanced_table_styling)

Now we'll go all\-out, with styles on rows in the header and body areas both, including alternating row colors, cells with different colors depending on position within a row, and so forth. Let's take a look at the result first this time.

#### Result

Here's what the final table will look like:

There is no change to the HTML again. See what proper preparation of the HTML structure can do?

\`\`\`
#### CSS

The CSS is much more involved this time. It's not complicated, but there's a lot going on. Let's break it down.

Here the [`border-collapse`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-collapse) and [`border-spacing`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-spacing) properties are added to eliminate spacing between cells and collapse borders that touch one another to be a single border instead of winding up with double borders. Additionally, the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) is placed at the `bottom` of the table using the [`caption-side`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caption-side) property:

css\`\`\`
table {
 border\-collapse: collapse;
 border\-spacing: 0;
 border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140\);
 font:
 16px "Open Sans",
 Helvetica,
 Arial,
 sans\-serif;
}

caption {
 caption\-side: bottom;
 padding: 10px;
 font\-weight: bold;
}

\`\`\`
Next, the [`padding`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) property is used to give all the table cells space around their content. The [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) property aligns the content of the header cells to the `bottom` of the cell, which can be seen on the cells in the head that span two rows:

css\`\`\`
th,
td {
 border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160\);
 padding: 4px 6px;
}

th {
 vertical\-align: bottom;
}

\`\`\`
The next CSS rule sets the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) of all [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements in the table's head (as specified using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead)). Then the bottom border of the head is set to be a two\-pixel wide line. Notice, however, that we're using the [`:nth-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) selector to apply the [`border-bottom`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-bottom) property to the *second* row in the head. Why? Because the head is made of two rows that are spanned by some of the cells. That means there are actually two rows there; applying the style to the first row would not give us the expected result:

css\`\`\`
thead \> tr {
 background\-color: rgb(228 240 245\);
}

thead \> tr:nth\-of\-type(2\) {
 border\-bottom: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140\);
}

\`\`\`
Let's style the two header cells "Joined" and "Canceled" with green and red hues to represent the "good" of a new member and the "bummer" of a canceled membership. Here we dig into the last row of the table's head section using the [`:last-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-of-type) selector and give the first header cell in it (the "Joined" header) a greenish color, and the second header cell in it (the "Canceled" header) a reddish hue:

css\`\`\`
thead \> tr:last\-of\-type \> th:nth\-of\-type(1\) {
 background\-color: rgb(225 255 225\);
}

thead \> tr:last\-of\-type \> th:nth\-of\-type(2\) {
 background\-color: rgb(255 225 225\);
}

\`\`\`
Since the first column should stand out as well, some custom styling is added here too. This CSS rule styles the first header cell in each row of the table's body with the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) property to left\-justify the member names, and with a somewhat different [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color):

css\`\`\`
tbody \> tr \> th:first\-of\-type {
 text\-align: left;
 background\-color: rgb(225 229 244\);
}

\`\`\`
It's common to help improve the readability of table data by alternating row colors—this is sometimes referred to as "zebra striping". Let's add a bit of [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) to every even row:

css\`\`\`
tbody \> tr:nth\-of\-type(even) {
 background\-color: rgb(237 238 242\);
}

\`\`\`
Since it's standard practice to right\-justify currency values in tables, let's do that here. This just sets the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) property for the last [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) in each body row to `right`:

css\`\`\`
tbody \> tr \> td:last\-of\-type {
 text\-align: right;
}

\`\`\`
Finally, some styling similar to the head is applied to the foot section of the table to make it stand out as well:

css\`\`\`
tfoot \> tr {
 border\-top: 2px dashed rgb(140 140 140\);
 background\-color: rgb(228 240 245\);
}

tfoot th,
tfoot td {
 text\-align: right;
 font\-weight: bold;
}

\`\`\`### [Displaying large tables in small spaces](#displaying_large_tables_in_small_spaces)

A common issue with tables on the web is that they don't natively work very well on small screens when the amount of content is large, and the way to make them scrollable isn't obvious, especially when the markup may come from a CMS and cannot be modified to have a wrapper.

This example provides one way to display tables in small spaces. We've hidden the HTML content as it is very large, and there is nothing remarkable about it. The CSS is more useful to inspect in this example.

#### CSS

When looking at these styles you'll notice that table's [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property has been set to `block`. While this allows scrolling, the table loses some of its integrity, and table cells try to become as small as possible. To mitigate this issue we've set [`white-space`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space) to `nowrap` on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody). However, we don't do this for the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) to avoid long titles forcing columns to be wider than they need to be to display the data.

To keep the table headers on the page while scrolling down we've set [`position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) to sticky on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements. Note that we have **not** set [`border-collapse`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-collapse) to `collapse`, as if we do the header cannot be separated correctly from the rest of the table.

Given that the `` has a fixed size, the [`overflow`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) set to `auto` is the important part here, as it makes the table scrollable.

## <tbody>: The Table Body element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element encapsulates a set of table rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements), indicating that they comprise the body of a table's (main) data.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of each body cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and on offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of each body cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of each body cell. Typical values for this include a period (`.`) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Specifies the number of characters to offset the body cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of each body cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` is placed after any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) elements.
* If [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements are specified as direct children of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) (see "tag omission" in the [technical summary](#technical_summary) for a description of when this is valid), then the markup generated by the browser will include a `` element that encapsulates them. As a result, CSS selectors such as `table > tr` will not select these elements. See also the [Not specifying a body](#not_specifying_a_body) example.
* It's permitted to use more than one `` per table as long as they are all consecutive. This allows to divide the rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements) in large tables into sections, each of which may be separately formatted if so desired. If not marked up to be consecutive elements, browsers will correct this author error, ensuring any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) elements are rendered as the first and last elements of the table, respectively.
* Along with its related [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) elements, the `` element provides useful [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) information and can be used when rendering for either screen or print. Specifying such table content groups also provides valuable contextual information for assistive technologies, including screen readers and search engines.
* When printing a document, in the case of a multipage table, the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) elements usually specify information that remains the same—or at least very similar—on each page, while the `` element's contents generally will differ from page to page.
* When a table is presented in a screen context (such as a window) that is not large enough to display the entire table, the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) may let the user scroll the contents of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), ``, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) blocks separately from one another for the same parent [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table).
## [Examples](#examples)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

### [Not specifying a body](#not_specifying_a_body)

This example demonstrates that the browser automatically encapsulates [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements within a `` element if the rows are not nested within a table grouping element (``, ``, or ``) and are, as in this example, the direct children of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element.

#### HTML

Here, a very basic table with some table rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements) containing data ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements) about students is created.

#### CSS

Note the CSS in the example, where a [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) is specified for the `` element and the `tbody` is used as a part of an additional [CSS selector](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_Selector). Alternatively, [browser developer tools](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Developer_Tools) can be used to check the presence of the `` element in the [DOM](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM).

css\`\`\`
tbody {
 background\-color: \#e4f0f5;

### [Basic body structure](#basic_body_structure)

This example extends and enhances the basic table from the [previous example](#not_specifying_a_body).

#### HTML

We introduce a table head ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) element) and explicitly use a `` element to structure the table into [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) sections. The table head contains the column headers ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements). The `` element represents the body section of the table, which contains a number of rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements) with the table's main data, which is the data of each student.

The use of such table content groups and [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) markup is not only useful for visual presentation (via CSS styling) and contextual information for assistive technologies; moreover, the explicit use of the `` element helps the browser to create the intended table structure, avoiding unwanted results.

\`\`\`
#### CSS

The CSS is nearly unchanged from the [previous example](#not_specifying_a_body), except for some basic styling to highlight the table head so that the headers of the columns stand out from the data in the table body. As in the [example above](#not_specifying_a_body), the `tbody` [type selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors) is used to style the body cells.

css\`\`\`
tbody {
 background\-color: \#e4f0f5;
}

tbody \> tr \> td:last\-of\-type {
 text\-align: center;
}

thead {

}

th,
td {
 border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160\);
 padding: 8px 10px;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Multiple bodies](#multiple_bodies)

This example extends and enhances the table from the [example above](#basic_body_structure) even more by introducing multiple body sections.

Using multiple `` elements allows creating row groupings within a table. Each table body can potentially have its own head row or rows; however, *there may only be one [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) element per table*! Because of that, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) with [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements can be used to create headers within each ``.

#### HTML

Building on the table in the [previous basic example](#basic_body_structure), more students are added and, instead of listing each student's major on each row, the students are grouped by major. Note that each major is enclosed within its own `` block, with the first row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element) serving as the head of the block, displaying the major title within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) element that uses the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#colspan) attribute to span the header across all three columns of the table. Each remaining row within each major's `` represents one student.

#### CSS

Most of the CSS is unchanged. However, a slightly more subtle style is added for header cells contained directly within a `` (as opposed to those that reside in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead)). This is used for the headers indicating each table section's corresponding major.

css\`\`\`

## <td>: The Table Data Cell element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a cell of a table that contains data and may be used as a child of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`colspan`](#colspan)

Contains a non\-negative integer value that indicates how many columns the data cell spans or extends. The default value is `1`. User agents dismiss values higher than 1000 as incorrect, setting to the default value (`1`).

[`headers`](#headers)

Contains a list of space\-separated strings, each corresponding to the `id` attribute of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements that provide headings for this table cell.

[`rowspan`](#rowspan)

Contains a non\-negative integer value that indicates for how many rows the data cell spans or extends. The default value is `1`; if its value is set to `0`, it extends until the end of the table grouping section ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot), even if implicitly defined), that the cell belongs to. Values higher than `65534` are clipped to `65534`.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`abbr` 
Deprecated](#abbr)

Contains a short abbreviated description of the data cell's content. Some user\-agents, such as speech readers, may present this description before the content itself. Put the abbreviated content inside the cell and place the (longer) description in the [`title`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title) attribute, as this attribute is deprecated. Or, preferably, include the content within the data cell, and use CSS to [visually clip overflowing text](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow).

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of the data cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and the offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`axis` 
Deprecated](#axis)

Contains a list of space\-separated strings, each corresponding to the `id` attribute of a group of cells that the data cell applies to.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of the data cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of the data cell. Typical values for this include a period (`.`) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the data cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`height` 
Deprecated](#height)

Defines a recommended data cell height. Use the [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`scope` 
Deprecated](#scope)

Defines the cells that the header (defined in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)) element relates to. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `row`, `col`, `rowgroup`, and `colgroup`. Only use this attribute with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) element to define the row or column for which it is a header, as this attribute is deprecated for the `` element.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of the data cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`width` 
Deprecated](#width)

Defines a recommended data cell width. Use the [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` may only be used within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element.
* When using the [`colspan`](#colspan) and [`rowspan`](#rowspan) attributes to span data cells across multiple columns and rows, cells without these attributes defined (with a default value of `1`) are automatically fitted into free available spaces in the table structure that span 1x1 cells, as illustrated in the following figure:



**Note:**
These attributes must not be used to overlap cells.
## [Examples](#examples)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

### [Basic data cells](#basic_data_cells)

This example uses `` elements along with other table\-related elements to introduce a basic table with data about the phonetic alphabet.

#### HTML

Some table rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements) contain both header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements) and data cell `` elements. The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) element that is the first child of each row forms the first column of the table, with each `` providing the row header for the data cells within that row. Each corresponding `` element contains data aligned with its respective column header and row header cell.

**Note:**
Normally, a table head group with column headers would be implemented to make it easier to understand the information in the columns. The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) elements would be used to group such rows of headers and data into the respective table head and body sections. This is not implemented in this example to focus on the data cells and reduce the complexity of this example.

#### CSS

Some basic CSS is used to style the table and its cells. CSS [attribute selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and the [`:nth-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) pseudo\-class are used to alternate the appearance of the cells to make the information in the table easier to understand and identify.

}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Column and row spanning](#column_and_row_spanning)

This example extends and enhances the basic table from the [previous example](#basic_data_cells) by adding an additional "ABC" cell.

#### HTML

An additional data cell (`` element) is introduced within the first row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element). This creates a fourth column in the table.

Using the [`rowspan`](#rowspan) attribute, the "ABC" cell is spanned across the first three rows of the table. The last data cells of the subsequent rows each span two columns. This is done using the [`colspan`](#colspan) attribute, aligning them correctly within the table structure. Note that an additional row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element) is added to the table to illustrate this.

#### CSS

The [`:first-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-of-type) and [`:last-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-of-type) pseudo\-classes are used in the CSS to select and style the added "ABC" data cell.

}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Associate data cells with header cells](#associate_data_cells_with_header_cells)

For more complex relationships between data cells (`` elements) and header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements), using [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements with the [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) attribute alone may not be sufficient for assistive technologies, especially screen readers.

#### HTML

To improve the [accessibility](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility) of the [previous example](#column_and_row_spanning) and to allow screen readers, for example, to speak the headers associated with each data cell, the [`headers`](#headers) attribute can be introduced along with [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attributes. Each row header cell ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) element) associated with the "ABC" data cell, i.e., the letters "A", "B", and "C", is given a unique identifier with the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute. The "ABC" data cell (`` element) then uses these `id` values in a space\-separated list for the [`headers`](#headers) attribute.

**Note:**
It's recommended to use more descriptive and useful values for the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute. Each `id` in a document must be unique to that document. In this example, the `id` values are single characters to maintain focus on the concept of the [`headers`](#headers) attribute.

#### Result

## <template>: The Content Template element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element serves as a mechanism for holding [HTML](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) fragments, which can either be used later via JavaScript or generated immediately into shadow DOM.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`shadowrootmode`](#shadowrootmode)

Creates a [shadow root](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shadow_tree) for the parent element.
It is a declarative version of the [`Element.attachShadow()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow) method and accepts the same [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values.

[`open`](#open)

Exposes the internal shadow root DOM for JavaScript (recommended for most use cases).

[`closed`](#closed)

Hides the internal shadow root DOM from JavaScript.

**Note:**
The HTML parser creates a [`ShadowRoot`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) object in the DOM for the first `` in a node with this attribute set to an allowed value.
If the attribute is not set, or not set to an allowed value — or if a `ShadowRoot` has already been declaratively created in the same parent — then an [`HTMLTemplateElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement) is constructed.
A [`HTMLTemplateElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement) cannot subsequently be changed into a shadow root after parsing, for example, by setting [`HTMLTemplateElement.shadowRootMode`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement/shadowRootMode).

**Note:**
You may find the non\-standard `shadowroot` attribute in older tutorials and examples that used to be supported in Chrome 90\-110\. This attribute has since been removed and replaced by the standard `shadowrootmode` attribute.

[`shadowrootclonable`](#shadowrootclonable)

Sets the value of the [`clonable`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot/clonable) property of a [`ShadowRoot`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) created using this element to `true`.
If set, a clone of the shadow host (the parent element of this ``) created with [`Node.cloneNode()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode) or [`Document.importNode()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/importNode) will include a shadow root in the copy.

[`shadowrootdelegatesfocus`](#shadowrootdelegatesfocus)

Sets the value of the [`delegatesFocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot/delegatesFocus) property of a [`ShadowRoot`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) created using this element to `true`.
If this is set and a non\-focusable element in the shadow tree is selected, then focus is delegated to the first focusable element in the tree.
The value defaults to `false`.

[`shadowrootserializable` 
Experimental](#shadowrootserializable)

Sets the value of the [`serializable`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot/serializable) property of a [`ShadowRoot`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) created using this element to `true`.
If set, the shadow root may be serialized by calling the [`Element.getHTML()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getHTML) or [`ShadowRoot.getHTML()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot/getHTML) methods with the `options.serializableShadowRoots` parameter set `true`.
The value defaults to `false`.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

There are two main ways to use the `` element.

### [Template document fragment](#template_document_fragment)

By default, the element's content is not rendered.
The corresponding [`HTMLTemplateElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement) interface includes a standard [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement/content "content") property (without an equivalent content/markup attribute). This `content` property is read\-only and holds a [`DocumentFragment`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment) that contains the DOM subtree represented by the template.
This fragment can be cloned via the [`cloneNode`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/cloneNode "cloneNode") method and inserted into the DOM.

Be careful when using the `content` property because the returned `DocumentFragment` can exhibit unexpected behavior.
For more details, see the [Avoiding DocumentFragment pitfalls](#avoiding_documentfragment_pitfalls) section below.

### [Declarative Shadow DOM](#declarative_shadow_dom)

If the `` element contains the [`shadowrootmode`](#shadowrootmode) attribute with a value of either `open` or `closed`, the HTML parser will immediately generate a shadow DOM. The element is replaced in the DOM by its content wrapped in a [`ShadowRoot`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot), which is attached to the parent element.
This is the declarative equivalent of calling [`Element.attachShadow()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow) to attach a shadow root to an element.

If the element has any other value for `shadowrootmode`, or does not have the `shadowrootmode` attribute, the parser generates a [`HTMLTemplateElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement).
Similarly, if there are multiple declarative shadow roots, only the first one is replaced by a [`ShadowRoot`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) — subsequent instances are parsed as [`HTMLTemplateElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTemplateElement) objects.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Generating table rows](#generating_table_rows)

First we start with the HTML portion of the example.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \UPC\_Code\
 \Product\_Name\
 \
 \
 \
 \
 \
\

\
 \
 \\
 \\
 \
\

\`\`\`
First, we have a table into which we will later insert content using JavaScript code. Then comes the template, which describes the structure of an HTML fragment representing a single table row.

Now that the table has been created and the template defined, we use JavaScript to insert rows into the table, with each row being constructed using the template as its basis.

js\`\`\`
// Test to see if the browser supports the HTML template element by checking
// for the presence of the template element's content attribute.
if ("content" in document.createElement("template")) {
 // Instantiate the table with the existing HTML tbody
 // and the row with the template
 const tbody = document.querySelector("tbody");
 const template = document.querySelector("\#productrow");

 // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
 const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
 let td = clone.querySelectorAll("td");
 td\[0].textContent = "1235646565";
 td\[1].textContent = "Stuff";

 tbody.appendChild(clone);

 // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
 const clone2 = template.content.cloneNode(true);
 td = clone2\.querySelectorAll("td");
 td\[0].textContent = "0384928528";
 td\[1].textContent = "Acme Kidney Beans 2";

 tbody.appendChild(clone2\);
} else {
 // Find another way to add the rows to the table because
 // the HTML template element is not supported.
}

\`\`\`
The result is the original HTML table, with two new rows appended to it via JavaScript:

\`\`\`
table {
 background: \#000;
}
table td {
 background: \#fff;
}

\`\`\`
### [Implementing a declarative shadow DOM](#implementing_a_declarative_shadow_dom)

In this example, a hidden support warning is included at the beginning of the markup. This warning is later set to be displayed via JavaScript if the browser doesn't support the `shadowrootmode` attribute. Next, there are two [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) elements, each containing nested [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style) elements with different behaviors. The first `` element is global to the whole document. The second one is scoped to the shadow root generated in place of the `` element because of the presence of the `shadowrootmode` attribute.

html\`\`\`
\
 ⛔ Your browser doesn't support \shadowrootmode\ attribute yet.
\
\
 \
 p {
 padding: 8px;
 background\-color: wheat;
 }
 \
 \I'm in the DOM.\
\
\
 \
 \
 p {
 padding: 8px;
 background\-color: plum;
 }
 \
 \I'm in the shadow DOM.\
 \
\

\`\`\`
js\`\`\`
const isShadowRootModeSupported =
 HTMLTemplateElement.prototype.hasOwnProperty("shadowRootMode");

document
 .querySelector("p\[hidden]")
 .toggleAttribute("hidden", isShadowRootModeSupported);

\`\`\`
### [Declarative Shadow DOM with delegated focus](#declarative_shadow_dom_with_delegated_focus)

This example demonstrates how `shadowrootdelegatesfocus` is applied to a shadow root that is created declaratively, and the effect this has on focus.

The code first declares a shadow root inside a `` element, using the `` element with the `shadowrootmode` attribute.
This displays both a non\-focusable `` containing text and a focusable `` element.
It also uses CSS to style elements with [`:focus`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) to blue, and to set the normal styling of the host element.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 :host {
 display: block;
 border: 1px dotted black;
 padding: 10px;
 margin: 10px;
 }
 :focus {
 outline: 2px solid blue;
 }
 \
 \Clickable Shadow DOM text\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
The second code block is identical except that it sets the `shadowrootdelegatesfocus` attribute, which delegates focus to the first focusable element in the tree if a non\-focusable element in the tree is selected.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 :host {
 display: block;
 border: 1px dotted black;
 padding: 10px;
 margin: 10px;
 }
 :focus {
 outline: 2px solid blue;
 }
 \
 \Clickable Shadow DOM text\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
Last of all we use the following CSS to apply a green\-yellow border to the parent `` element when it has focus.

css\`\`\`
div:focus {
 border: 2px solid red;
}

\`\`\`
The results are shown below.
When the HTML is first rendered, the elements have no styling, as shown in the first image.
For the shadow root that does not have `shadowrootdelegatesfocus` set you can click anywhere except the `` and the focus does not change (if you select the `` element it will look like the second image).



For the shadow root with `shadowrootdelegatesfocus` set, clicking on the text (which is non\-focusable) selects the `` element, as this is the first focusable element in the tree.
This also focuses the parent element as shown below.



## [Avoiding DocumentFragment pitfalls](#avoiding_documentfragment_pitfalls)

When a [`DocumentFragment`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment) value is passed, [`Node.appendChild`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) and similar methods move only the *child nodes* of that value into the target node. Therefore, it is usually preferable to attach event handlers to the children of a `DocumentFragment`, rather than to the `DocumentFragment` itself.

Consider the following HTML and JavaScript:

### [HTML](#html)

html\`\`\`
\\

\
 \Click me\
\

\`\`\`### [JavaScript](#javascript)

js\`\`\`
const container = document.getElementById("container");
const template = document.getElementById("template");

function clickHandler(event) {
 event.target.append(" — Clicked this div");
}

const firstClone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
firstClone.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
container.appendChild(firstClone);

const secondClone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
secondClone.children\[0].addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
container.appendChild(secondClone);

\`\`\`### [Result](#result)

Since `firstClone` is a `DocumentFragment`, only its children are added to `container` when `appendChild` is called; the event handlers of `firstClone` are not copied. In contrast, because an event handler is added to the first *child node* of `secondClone`, the event handler is copied when `appendChild` is called, and clicking on it works as one would expect.

## <textarea>: The Textarea element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a multi\-line plain\-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free\-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.

## [Try it](#try_it)

The above example demonstrates a number of features of ``:

* An `id` attribute to allow the `` to be associated with a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element for accessibility purposes
* A `name` attribute to set the name of the associated data point submitted to the server when the form is submitted.
* `rows` and `cols` attributes to allow you to specify an exact size for the `` to take. Setting these is a good idea for consistency, as browser defaults can differ.
* The `` element specifies its content differently in HTML and JavaScript contexts:
	+ In HTML, the initial content of a `` is specified between its opening and closing tags, not as a `value` attribute.
	+ In JavaScript, `` elements have a [`value`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement/value) property that can be used to get or set the current content, and [`defaultValue`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement/defaultValue) to get and set its initial value (equivalent to accessing the HTML element's text content).

The `` element also accepts several attributes common to form ``s, such as `autocapitalize`, `autocomplete`, `autofocus`, `disabled`, `placeholder`, `readonly`, and `required`.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`autocapitalize`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocapitalize)

Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so, in what manner.

[`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)

Controls whether entered text can be automatically completed by the browser. Possible values are:

* `off`: The user must explicitly enter a value into this field for every use, or the document provides its own auto\-completion method; the browser does not automatically complete the entry.
* `on`: The browser can automatically complete the value based on values that the user has entered during previous uses.
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#token_list_tokens): An ordered set of space\-separated autofill detail tokens, optionally preceded by a sectioning token, a billing or shipping grouping token, and/or a token identifying the type of recipient.

`` elements that don't specify the `autocomplete` attribute inherit the `autocomplete` `on` or `off` status set on the ``'s form owner. The form owner is either the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element that this `` element is a descendant of or the form element whose `id` is specified by the `form` attribute of the input element. For more information, see the [`autocomplete`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#autocomplete) attribute in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form).

[`autocorrect`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocorrect)

Controls whether automatic spelling correction and processing of text is enabled while the user is editing this `textarea`.
Permitted values are:

[`on`](#on)

Enable automatic spelling correction and text substitutions.

[`off`](#off)

Disable automatic spelling correction and text substitutions.

[`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus)

This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should have input focus when the page loads. Only one form\-associated element in a document can have this attribute specified.

[`cols`](#cols)

The visible width of the text control, in average character widths. If it is specified, it must be a positive integer. If it is not specified, the default value is `20`.

[`dirname`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/dirname)

This attribute is used to indicate the text directionality of the element contents.
For more information, see the [`dirname` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/dirname).

[`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled)

This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot interact with the control. If this attribute is not specified, the control inherits its setting from the containing element, for example [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset); if there is no containing element when the `disabled` attribute is set, the control is enabled.

[`form`](#form)

The form element that the `` element is associated with (its "form owner"). The value of the attribute must be the `id` of a form element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, the `` element must be a descendant of a form element. This attribute enables you to place `` elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of form elements.

[`maxlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/maxlength)

The maximum string length (measured in UTF\-16 code units) that the user can enter. If this value isn't specified, the user can enter an unlimited number of characters.

[`minlength`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/minlength)

The minimum string length (measured in UTF\-16 code units) required that the user should enter.

[`name`](#name)

The name of the control.

[`placeholder`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/placeholder)

A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control. Carriage returns or line\-feeds within the placeholder text must be treated as line breaks when rendering the hint.

**Note:**
Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the type of data that should be entered into a form; they are *not* a substitute for a proper [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element tied to the input. See [`` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#labels) for a full explanation.

[`readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly)

This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot modify the value of the control. Unlike the `disabled` attribute, the `readonly` attribute does not prevent the user from clicking or selecting in the control. The value of a read\-only control is still submitted with the form.

[`required`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/required)

This attribute specifies that the user must fill in a value before submitting a form.

[`rows`](#rows)

The number of visible text lines for the control. If it is specified, it must be a positive integer. If it is not specified, the default value is 2\.

[`spellcheck`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/spellcheck)

Specifies whether the `` is subject to spell\-checking by the underlying browser/OS. The value can be:

* `true`: Indicates that the element needs to have its spelling and grammar checked.
* `default` : Indicates that the element is to act according to a default behavior, possibly based on the parent element's own `spellcheck` value.
* `false` : Indicates that the element should not be spell\-checked.

[`wrap`](#wrap)

Indicates how the control should wrap the value for form submission. Possible values are:

* `hard`: The browser automatically inserts line breaks (CR\+LF) so that each line is no longer than the width of the control; the [`cols`](#cols) attribute must be specified for this to take effect
* `soft`: The browser ensures that all line breaks in the entered value are a `CR+LF` pair, but no additional line breaks are added to the value.
* `off` 
Non\-standard
: Like `soft` but changes appearance to `white-space: pre` so line segments exceeding `cols` are not wrapped and the `` becomes horizontally scrollable.

If this attribute is not specified, `soft` is its default value.

## [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

`` is a [replaced element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element) — it has intrinsic dimensions, like a raster image. By default, its [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) value is `inline-block`. Compared to other form elements it is relatively easy to style, with its box model, fonts, color scheme, etc. being easily manipulable using regular CSS.

[Styling HTML forms](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Styling_web_forms) provides some useful tips on styling ``s.

### [Baseline inconsistency](#baseline_inconsistency)

The HTML specification doesn't define where the baseline of a `` is, so different browsers set it to different positions. For Gecko, the `` baseline is set on the baseline of the first line of the textarea, on another browser it may be set on the bottom of the `` box. Don't use [`vertical-align: baseline`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) on it; the behavior is unpredictable.

### [Controlling whether a textarea is resizable](#controlling_whether_a_textarea_is_resizable)

In most browsers, ``s are resizable — you'll notice the drag handle in the right\-hand corner, which can be used to alter the size of the element on the page. This is controlled by the [`resize`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resize) CSS property — resizing is enabled by default, but you can explicitly disable it using a `resize` value of `none`:

css\`\`\`
textarea {
 resize: none;
}

\`\`\`### [Styling valid and invalid values](#styling_valid_and_invalid_values)

Valid and invalid values of a `` element (e.g. those within, and outside the bounds set by `minlength`, `maxlength`, or `required`) can be highlighted using the [`:valid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:valid) and [`:invalid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) pseudo\-classes. For example, to give your textarea a different border depending on whether it is valid or invalid:

css\`\`\`
textarea:invalid {
 border: 2px dashed red;
}

textarea:valid {
 border: 2px solid lime;
}

\`\`\`## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic example](#basic_example)

The following example shows a textarea with a set number of rows and columns, some default content, and CSS styles that prevent users from resizing the element more than 500px wide and 130px high:

html\`\`\`
\Write something here\

\`\`\`
css\`\`\`
textarea {
 max\-height: 130px;
 max\-width: 500px;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Example using "minlength" and "maxlength"](#example_using_minlength_and_maxlength)

This example has a minimum and maximum number of characters — of 10 and 20 respectively. Try it and see.

html\`\`\`
\
Write something here…
\

\`\`\`
css\`\`\`
textarea {
 max\-height: 130px;
 max\-width: 500px;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

Note that `minlength` doesn't stop the user from removing characters so that the number entered goes past the minimum, but it does make the value entered into the `` invalid. Also note that even if you have a `minlength` value set (3, for example), an empty `` is still considered valid unless you also have the `required` attribute set.

### [Example using "placeholder"](#example_using_placeholder)

This example has a placeholder set. Notice how it disappears when you start typing into the box.

html\`\`\`
\\

\`\`\`
css\`\`\`
textarea {
 max\-height: 130px;
 max\-width: 500px;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

**Note:**
Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the type of data that should be entered into a form; they are *not* a substitute for a proper [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) element tied to the input. See [`` labels](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#labels) for a full explanation.

### [Disabled and readonly text areas](#disabled_and_readonly_text_areas)

This example shows two ``s — one is [`readonly`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) and one is [`disabled`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled).
You cannot edit the contents of either element, but the `readonly` element is focusable and its value is submitted in forms.
The `disabled` element's value is not submitted and it's not focusable.

html\`\`\`
\
I am a read\-only textarea.
\
\
I am a disabled textarea.
\

\`\`\`
css\`\`\`
textarea {
 display: block;
 resize: horizontal;
 max\-width: 500px;
}

## <tfoot>: The Table Foot element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element encapsulates a set of table rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements), indicating that they comprise the foot of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the columns, e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of each foot cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and on offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of each foot cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of each foot cell. Typical values for this include a period (`.`) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the foot cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of each foot cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` is placed after any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements.
* Along with its related [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) elements, the `` element provides useful [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) information and can be used when rendering for either screen or print. Specifying such table content groups also provides valuable contextual information for assistive technologies, including screen readers and search engines.
* When printing a document, in the case of a multipage table, the table foot usually specifies information that is output as an intermediate summary on each page.
## [Example](#example)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

### [Table with footer](#table_with_footer)

This example demonstrates a table divided into a head section with column headers, a body section with the table's main data, and a foot section summarizing data of one column.

#### HTML

The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), and `` elements are used to structure a basic table into [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) sections. The `` element represents the foot section of the table, which contains a row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)) representing the calculated average of the values in the "Credits" column.

To allocate the cells in the foot to the correct columns, the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#colspan) attribute is used on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) element to span row header cell across the first three table columns. The single data cell ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)) in the foot is automatically placed in the correct location, i.e., the fourth column, with the omitted [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td#colspan) attribute value defaulting to `1`. Additionally, the [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) attribute is set to `row` on the header cell ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)) in the foot to explicitly define that this foot header cell relates to the table cells within the same row, which in our example is the one data cell in the foot row that contains the calculated average.

## <th>: The Table Header element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a cell as the header of a group of table cells and may be used as a child of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element. The exact nature of this group is defined by the [`scope`](#scope) and [`headers`](#headers) attributes.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`abbr`](#abbr)

A short, abbreviated description of the header cell's content provided as an alternative label to use for the header cell when referencing the cell in other contexts. Some user\-agents, such as speech readers, may present this description before the content itself.

[`colspan`](#colspan)

A non\-negative integer value indicating how many columns the header cell spans or extends. The default value is `1`. User agents dismiss values higher than 1000 as incorrect, defaulting such values to `1`.

[`headers`](#headers)

A list of space\-separated strings corresponding to the `id` attributes of the `` elements that provide the headers for this header cell.

[`rowspan`](#rowspan)

A non\-negative integer value indicating how many rows the header cell spans or extends. The default value is `1`; if its value is set to `0`, the header cell will extends to the end of the table grouping section ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot), even if implicitly defined), that the `` belongs to. Values higher than `65534` are clipped at `65534`.

[`scope`](#scope)

Defines the cells that the header (defined in the ``) element relates to. Possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are:

* `row`: the header relates to all cells of the row it belongs to;
* `col`: the header relates to all cells of the column it belongs to;
* `rowgroup`: the header belongs to a rowgroup and relates to all of its cells;
* `colgroup`: the header belongs to a colgroup and relates to all of its cells.

If the `scope` attribute is not specified, or its value is not `row`, `col`, `rowgroup`, or `colgroup`, then browsers automatically select the set of cells to which the header cell applies.

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of the header cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and the offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`axis` 
Deprecated](#axis)

Contains a list of space\-separated strings, each corresponding to the `id` attribute of a group of cells that the header cell applies to. Use the [`scope`](#scope) attribute instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of the header cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of the header cell. Typical values for this include a period (`.`) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the header cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`height` 
Deprecated](#height)

Defines a recommended header cell height. Use the [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of the header cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`width` 
Deprecated](#width)

Defines a recommended header cell width. Use the [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` may only be used within a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element.
* In simple contexts, using the [`scope`](#scope) attribute on header cells (`` elements) is redundant because [`scope`](#scope) is inferred. However, certain assistive technologies may fail to infer correctly, so specifying header scope may improve user experiences.
* When using the [`colspan`](#colspan) and [`rowspan`](#rowspan) attributes to span header cells across multiple columns and rows, cells without these attributes defined (with a default value of `1`) are automatically fitted into free available spaces in the table structure that span 1x1 cells, as illustrated in the following figure:



**Note:**
These attributes must not be used to overlap cells.
## [Examples](#examples)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

### [Basic column and row headers](#basic_column_and_row_headers)

This example uses `` elements to introduce column and row headers in a basic table structure.

#### HTML

The first row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element) contains the column headers (`` elements), which act as "titles" for the columns to make it easier to understand the information in the columns and identify the data. To indicate that each column header relates to all cells in the corresponding column, the [`scope`](#scope) attribute is set to `col` (column).

The remaining rows contain the main data of the table. Each of these rows has a row header (`` element) introduced as the first cell. This creates a column with row headers as the first column of the table. Similar to the column headers, the [`scope`](#scope) attribute is set to `row` to specify which cells each row header relates to, which in the example below are all data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements) in each `row`.

**Note:**
Normally, the grouping elements [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) are used to group rows with headers into the respective table head and body sections. These elements are omitted in this example to reduce complexity and enable focusing on the use of header cells.

#### CSS

Some basic CSS is used to style the table and its cells. We use CSS [attribute selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) to target header cells based on their [`scope`](#scope) attribute values, highlighting column and row headers (`` elements) and differentiating them each other and from the data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)).

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Column and row spanning](#column_and_row_spanning)

This example extends and enhances the basic table from the [previous example](#basic_column_and_row_headers) by adding a second row for additional column headers.

#### HTML

An additional table row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element) is added as the second header row of the table with two additional column headers (`` elements). In this way, the "Pronunciation" column is split into two columns, one for the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation and one for the respelling (the original pronunciation column). The corresponding data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements) are added to each subsequent row.

As shown in the [usage notes](#usage_notes), the [`colspan`](#colspan) and [`rowspan`](#rowspan) attributes can be used for the `` elements to allocate the header cells to the correct columns and rows. To achieve a "two\-row" header in the table structure, the first two header cells within the first [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element are spanned across two rows. The third header cell is spanned two columns wide (remaining in the first row). This setup leaves two available areas in the third and fourth columns in the second row, where the two headers within the second [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) element are automatically placed, with the default value being `1` for the [`colspan`](#colspan) and [`rowspan`](#rowspan) attributes.

**Note:**
Normally, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) elements are used to group rows with headers into the respective table head and body sections. This is not implemented in this example to focus on the headers and spanning and reduce the example's complexity.

### [Associate header cells with other header cells](#associate_header_cells_with_other_header_cells)

For more complex relationships between header cells, using `th` elements with the [`scope`](#scope) attribute alone may not be sufficient for assistive technologies, especially screen readers.

#### HTML

To improve the [accessibility](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility) of the [previous example](#column_and_row_spanning) and to allow screen readers, for example, to speak the headers associated with each header cell, the [`headers`](#headers) attribute can be introduced along with [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attributes. Because of the way the "Pronunciation" column is split into two columns in the example, introducing a "two row" header, assistive technologies such as screen readers may not be able to identify which additional header cells (`th` elements) the "Pronunciation" header cell is related to and vice versa. Therefore, the [`headers`](#headers) attribute is used on the "Pronunciation", "IPA", and "Respelling" header cells to associate the related header cells based on the values of the unique identifiers from the added [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attributes in the form of a space\-separated list.

**Note:**
It's recommended to use more descriptive and useful values for the [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id) attribute. Each `id` in a document must be unique to that document. In this example, the `id` values are single characters to maintain focus on the concept of the [`headers`](#headers) attribute.

## <thead>: The Table Head element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element encapsulates a set of table rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements), indicating that they comprise the head of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually in the form of column headers ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements).

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of each head cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and the offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of each head cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of each head cell. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Does nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the head cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of each head cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` is placed after any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) elements, but before any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot), and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr) elements.
* Along with its related [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) elements, the `` element provides useful [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) information and can be used when rendering for either screen or print. Specifying such table content groups also provides valuable contextual information for assistive technologies, including screen readers and search engines.
* When printing a document, in the case of a multipage table, the table head usually specifies information that remains the same on each page.
## [Examples](#examples)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

### [Basic head structure](#basic_head_structure)

This example demonstrates a table divided into a head section with column headers and a body section with the table's main data.

#### HTML

The `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) elements are used to structure the table rows into [semantic](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) sections. The `` element represents the head section of the table, which contains a row ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)) of column headers cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)).

#### CSS

Some basic CSS is used to style and highlight the table head so that the headings of the columns stand out from the data in the table body.

### [Multiple head rows](#multiple_head_rows)

This example demonstrates a table head section with two rows.

#### HTML

We extend the markup the table from the [basic example](#basic_head_structure) in this example by including two table rows ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)) within the `` element creating a multi\-row table head. We included an additional column, splitting the student names into first and last names.

#### Cell spanning

In order to associate and line up the header cells with the correct columns and rows, the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#colspan) and [`rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#rowspan) attributes are used on the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements. The values set in these attributes specify how many cells each header cell ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)) spans. Due to the way these attributes are set, the two second\-row header cells are lined up with the columns they head. These each span one row and one column as the default values for the [`colspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#colspan) and [`rowspan`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#rowspan) attributes are both `1`.

The column and row spanning demonstrated by this example are illustrated in the following figure:

## <time>: The (Date) Time element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a specific period in time. It may include the `datetime` attribute to translate dates into machine\-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.

It may represent one of the following:

* A time on a 24\-hour clock.
* A precise date in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) (with optional time and timezone information).
* [A valid time duration](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#valid-duration-string).
## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`datetime`](#datetime)

This attribute indicates the time and/or date of the element and must be in one of the formats described below.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

This element is for presenting dates and times in a machine\-readable format. For example, this can help a user agent offer to add an event to a user's calendar.

This element should not be used for dates prior to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar (due to complications in calculating those dates).

The *datetime value* (the machine\-readable value of the datetime) is the value of the element's `datetime` attribute, which must be in the proper format (see below). If the element does not have a `datetime` attribute, **it must not have any element descendants**, and the *datetime value* is the element's child text content.

### [Valid datetime values](#valid_datetime_values)

The `` element is always used within a page's [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) block.

### [Page titles and SEO](#page_titles_and_seo)

The contents of a page title can have significant implications for search engine optimization ([SEO](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO)). In general, a longer, descriptive title performs better than short or generic titles. The content of the title is one of the components used by search engine algorithms to decide the order in which to list pages in search results. Also, the title is the initial "hook" by which you grab the attention of readers glancing at the search results page.

A few guidelines and tips for composing good titles:

* Avoid one\- or two\-word titles. Use a descriptive phrase, or a term\-definition pairing for glossary or reference\-style pages.
* Search engines typically display about the first 55–60 characters of a page title. Text beyond that may be lost, so try not to have titles longer than that. If you must use a longer title, make sure the important parts come earlier and that nothing critical is in the part of the title that is likely to be dropped.
* Don't use "keyword blobs." If your title is just a list of words, algorithms often reduce your page's position in the search results.
* Try to make sure your titles are as unique as possible within your own site. Duplicate—or near\-duplicate—titles can contribute to inaccurate search results.
## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

It is important to provide an accurate and concise title to describe the page's purpose.

A common navigation technique for users of assistive technology is to read the page title and infer the content the page contains. This is because navigating into a page to determine its content can be a time\-consuming and potentially confusing process. Titles should be unique to every page of a website, ideally surfacing the primary purpose of the page first, followed by the name of the website. Following this pattern will help ensure that the primary purpose of the page is announced by a screen reader first. This provides a far better experience than having to listen to the name of a website before the unique page title, for every page a user navigates to in the same website.

### [Examples](#examples)

html\`\`\`
\Menu \- Blue House Chinese Food \- FoodYum: Online takeout today!\

\`\`\`
If a form submission contains errors and the submission re\-renders the current page, the title can be used to help make users aware of any errors with their submission. For instance, update the page `title` value to reflect significant page state changes (such as form validation problems).

html\`\`\`
\
 2 errors \- Your order \- Sea Food Store \- Food: Online takeout today!
\

\`\`\`

**Note:**
Presently, dynamically updating a page's title will not be automatically announced by screen readers. If you are going to update the page title to reflect significant changes to a page's state, then the use of [ARIA Live Regions](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) may be necessary, as well.

## <tr>: The Table Row element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tr)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) (data cell) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) (header cell) elements.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

### [Deprecated attributes](#deprecated_attributes)

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

[`align` 
Deprecated](#align)

Specifies the horizontal alignment of each row cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`, and `char`. When supported, the `char` value aligns the textual content on the character defined in the [`char`](#char) attribute and on offset defined by the [`charoff`](#charoff) attribute. Use the [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`bgcolor` 
Deprecated](#bgcolor)

Defines the background color of each row cell. The value is an HTML color; either a [6\-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hex-color), prefixed by a `#`, or a [color keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color). Other CSS [``](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) values are not supported. Use the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

[`char` 
Deprecated](#char)

Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of each row cell. Typical values for this include a period (`.`) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If [`align`](#align) is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored.

[`charoff` 
Deprecated](#charoff)

Specifies the number of characters to offset the row cell content from the alignment character specified by the [`char`](#char) attribute.

[`valign` 
Deprecated](#valign)

Specifies the vertical alignment of each row cell. The possible [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) values are `baseline`, `bottom`, `middle`, and `top`. Use the [`vertical-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) CSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` element is valid as a child of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tfoot) element only.
* If the `` is placed as a direct child of its parent [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element, the `` parent is implied and browsers will add the `` to the markup.
* The implied `` parent is only supported if the `` otherwise has no child `` elements, and only if the `` is included after any [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup), and `` elements.
* The CSS pseudo\-classes [`:nth-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type), [`:first-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-of-type), and [`:last-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-of-type) are often useful for selecting the desired set of rows and their data and header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements).
* When a `` is included as a direct child of the ``, as the browser adds a `` to the markup, CSS selectors such as `table > tr` may not work as expected or at all.
## [Examples](#examples)

See [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) for a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.

### [Basic row setup](#basic_row_setup)

This example demonstrates a table with four rows and three columns, where the first column contains headers for the row data cells.

#### HTML

Four `` elements are used to create four table rows. Each row contains three cells \- one header cell ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)) and two data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)) \- creating three columns. The [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) attribute set on each header cell specifies which cells they relate to, which in this example is all data cells within the `row`.

 \Delta\
 \DELL tah\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### CSS

The CSS [`:nth-of-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) pseudo\-class is used to select every `odd` row and set the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) of those rows to a slightly darker tone, creating a so\-called "zebra stripe" effect. This alternating background makes the rows of data in the table easier to parse and read—imagine having many rows and columns and trying to find some data in a particular row. In addition, the row header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) elements) are highlighted with a [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) to distinguish them from the data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements).

css\`\`\`
tr:nth\-of\-type(odd) {
 background\-color: \#eee;
}

tr th\[scope="row"] {
 background\-color: \#d6ecd4;
}

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
table {
 border\-collapse: collapse;
 border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140\);

 letter\-spacing: 1px;
}

th,
td {
 border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160\);
 padding: 8px 10px;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Header row](#header_row)

This example extends the basic table from the [previous example](#basic_row_setup) by adding a header row as the first row of the table.

#### HTML

An additional table row (``) is added as the first row of the table with column header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th)) providing a header for each column. We put this row in a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) grouping element to indicate this is the header of the table. The [`scope`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th#scope) attribute is added to each header cell (``) within this head row to explicitly specify that each header cell relates to all the cells within its own column, even though those cells are in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody).

#### CSS

The CSS is nearly unchanged from the [previous example](#basic_row_setup), except for some additional styling to highlight the "header row" so that the headers of the columns stand out from the other cells.

css\`\`\`
tr:nth\-of\-type(odd) {
 background\-color: \#eee;

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Sorting rows](#sorting_rows)

There are no native methods for sorting the rows (`` elements) of a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table). But using [`Array.prototype.sort()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort), [`Node.removeChild`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild), and [`Node.appendChild`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild), a custom `sort()` function can be implemented in JavaScript to sort an [`HTMLCollection`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection) of `` elements.

#### HTML

A [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) element is used in this basic table to mark the body section of the table and to include three rows (`` elements) with data ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements), creating one column with numbers in descending order.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \3\
 \
 \

 \
 \
 \1\
 \
 \
\

\`\`\`
#### JavaScript

In the JavaScript code below, the created `sort()` function is attached to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) element so that it sorts the table cells in order of increasing value and updates the display accordingly.

js\`\`\`
HTMLTableSectionElement.prototype.sort = function (cb) {
 Array.from(this.rows)
 .sort(cb)
 .forEach((e) =\> this.appendChild(this.removeChild(e)));
};

document
 .querySelector("table")
 .tBodies\[0].sort((a, b) =\> a.textContent.localeCompare(b.textContent));

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
table {
 border\-collapse: collapse;
 border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140\);
 font\-family: sans\-serif;
 font\-size: 0\.8rem;
 letter\-spacing: 1px;
}

td {
 border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160\);
 padding: 4px 8px;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Sorting rows with a click on header cells](#sorting_rows_with_a_click_on_header_cells)

This example extends the basic table from the [previous example](#sorting_rows) by making the sorting interactive and independent for multiple columns.

#### HTML

An additional data cell ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) element) is added to each row (`` element) within the table body ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) element) to create a second column with letters in ascending order. Using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/thead) element, a head section is added before the body section to introduce a head row with table header cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) element). These header cells are used in the JavaScript code below to make them clickable and then to perform the corresponding sorting when activated per click.

\`\`\`
#### JavaScript

A click event handler is added to each table header ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) element) of each [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) in the [`document`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDocument "document"); it sorts all the rows (`` elements) of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tbody) based on the contents of the data cells ([``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements) contained in the rows.

**Note:**
This solution assumes that the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td) elements are populated by raw text with no descendant elements.

js\`\`\`
const allTables = document.querySelectorAll("table");

for (const table of allTables) {
 const tBody = table.tBodies\[0];
 const rows = Array.from(tBody.rows);
 const headerCells = table.tHead.rows\[0].cells;

 for (const th of headerCells) {
 const cellIndex = th.cellIndex;

 th.addEventListener("click", () =\> {
 rows.sort((tr1, tr2\) =\> {
 const tr1Text = tr1\.cells\[cellIndex].textContent;
 const tr2Text = tr2\.cells\[cellIndex].textContent;
 return tr1Text.localeCompare(tr2Text);
 });

 tBody.append(...rows);
 });
 }
}

\`\`\`
\`\`\`
table {
 border\-collapse: collapse;
 border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140\);
 font\-family: sans\-serif;
 font\-size: 0\.8rem;
 letter\-spacing: 1px;
}

th,
td {
 border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160\);
 padding: 4px 8px;
}

th {
 background\-color: \#505050;
 color: \#fff;
 cursor: pointer;
}

\`\`\`
#### Result

**Note:**
To be usable and accessible, the header cell of each sortable column must be identifiable as a sorting button and each must define whether the column is currently sorted in ascending or descending order visually and with the [`aria-sort`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-sort) attribute. See the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)'s [sortable table example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/table/examples/sortable-table/) for more information.

## <track>: The Embed Text Track element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used as a child of the media elements, [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video).
Each track element lets you specify a timed text track (or time\-based data) that can be displayed in parallel with the media element, for example to overlay subtitles or closed captions on top of a video or alongside audio tracks.

Multiple tracks can be specified for a media element, containing different kinds of timed text data, or timed text data that has been translated for different locales.
The data that is used will either be the track that has been set to be the default, or a kind and translation based on user preferences.

The tracks are formatted in [WebVTT format](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) (`.vtt` files) — Web Video Text Tracks.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`default`](#default)

This attribute indicates that the track should be enabled unless the user's preferences indicate that another track is more appropriate. This may only be used on one `track` element per media element.

[`kind`](#kind)

How the text track is meant to be used. If omitted the default kind is `subtitles`. If the attribute contains an invalid value, it will use `metadata`.
The following keywords are allowed:

* `subtitles`

	+ Subtitles provide translation of content that cannot be understood by the viewer. For example speech or text that is not English in an English language film.
	+ Subtitles may contain additional content, usually extra background information. For example the text at the beginning of the Star Wars films, or the date, time, and location of a scene.
* `captions`

	+ Closed captions provide a transcription and possibly a translation of audio.
	+ It may include important non\-verbal information such as music cues or sound effects.
	It may indicate the cue's source (e.g. music, text, character).
	+ Suitable for users who are deaf or when the sound is muted.
* `chapters`

	+ Chapter titles are intended to be used when the user is navigating the media resource.
* `metadata`

	+ Tracks used by scripts. Not visible to the user.

[`label`](#label)

A user\-readable title of the text track which is used by the browser when listing available text tracks.

[`src`](#src)

Address of the track (`.vtt` file). Must be a valid URL. This attribute must be specified and its URL value must have the same origin as the document — unless the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) parent element of the `track` element has a [`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) attribute.

[`srclang`](#srclang)

Language of the track text data. It must be a valid [BCP 47](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/) language tag. If the `kind` attribute is set to `subtitles`, then `srclang` must be defined.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

### [Track data types](#track_data_types)

The type of data that `track` adds to the media is set in the `kind` attribute, which can take values of `subtitles`, `captions`, `chapters` or `metadata`. The element points to a source file containing timed text that the browser exposes when the user requests additional data.

A media element cannot have more than one `track` with the same `kind`, `srclang`, and `label`.

### [Detecting cue changes](#detecting_cue_changes)

The underlying [`TextTrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextTrack), indicated by the [`track`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTrackElement/track "track") property, receives a `cuechange` event every time the currently\-presented cue is changed. This happens even if the track isn't associated with a media element.

If the track *is* associated with a media element, using the `` element as a child of the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element, the `cuechange` event is also sent to the [`HTMLTrackElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTrackElement).

js\`\`\`
let textTrackElem = document.getElementById("text\-track");

textTrackElem.addEventListener("cuechange", (event) =\> {
 let cues = event.target.track.activeCues;
});

\`\`\`### [Adding text tracks programmatically](#adding_text_tracks_programmatically)

The JavaScript interface that represents the `` element is [`HTMLTrackElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTrackElement).
The text track associated with an element can be obtained from the [`HTMLTrackElement.track`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTrackElement/track) property, and is of type [`TextTrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextTrack).

`TextTrack` objects also can be added to a [`HTMLVideoElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement) or [`HTMLAudioElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement) elements using the [`HTMLMediaElement.addTextTrack()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/addTextTrack) method.
The `TextTrack` objects associated with a media element stored in a [`TextTrackList`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextTrackList), which can be retrieved using the [`HTMLMediaElement.textTracks`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/textTracks) property.

## <tt>: The Teletype Text element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/tt)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element creates inline text which is presented using the [user agent's](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed\-width display such as a teletype, text\-only screen, or line printer.

The terms **non\-proportional**, **monotype**, and **monospace** are used interchangeably and have the same general meaning: they describe a typeface whose characters are all the same number of pixels wide.

This element is obsolete, however. You should use the more semantically helpful [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd), [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp), or [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/var) elements for inline text that needs to be presented in monospace type, or the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre) tag for content that should be presented as a separate block.

**Note:**
If none of the semantic elements are appropriate for your use case (for example, if you need to show some content in a non\-proportional font), you should consider using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element, styling it as desired using CSS. The [`font-family`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) property is a good place to start.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes)

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Basic example](#basic_example)

This example uses `` to show text entered into, and output by, a terminal application.

html\`\`\`
\
 Enter the following at the telnet command prompt:
 \set localecho\\

 The telnet client should display: \Local Echo is on\
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

### [Overriding the default font](#overriding_the_default_font)

You can override the browser's default font—if the browser permits you to do so, which it isn't required to do—using CSS:

#### CSS

css\`\`\`
tt {
 font\-family: "Lucida Console", "Menlo", "Monaco", "Courier", monospace;
}

\`\`\`
#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
 Enter the following at the telnet command prompt:
 \set localecho\\

 The telnet client should display: \Local Echo is on\
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `` element is, by default, rendered using the browser's default non\-proportional font. You can override this using CSS by creating a rule using the `tt` selector, as seen in the example [Overriding the default font](#overriding_the_default_font) above.

**Note:**
User\-configured changes to the default monospace font setting may take precedence over your CSS.

Although this element wasn't officially deprecated in HTML 4\.01, its use was discouraged in favor of the semantic elements and/or CSS. The `` element is obsolete in HTML 5\.

## <u>: The Unarticulated Annotation (Underline) element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non\-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a single solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.

**Warning:**
This element used to be called the "Underline" element in older versions of HTML, and is still sometimes misused in this way. To underline text, you should instead apply a style that includes the CSS [`text-decoration`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration) property set to `underline`.

## [Try it](#try_it)

See the [Usage notes](#usage_notes) section for further details on when it's appropriate to use `` and when it isn't.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

Along with other pure styling elements, the original HTML Underline (``) element was deprecated in HTML 4; however, `` was restored in HTML 5 with a new, semantic, meaning: to mark text as having some form of non\-textual annotation applied.

**Note:**
Avoid using the `` element with its default styling (of underlined text) in such a way as to be confused with a hyperlink, which is also underlined by default.

### [Use cases](#use_cases)

Valid use cases for the `` element include annotating spelling errors, applying a [proper name mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_name_mark) to denote proper names in Chinese text, and other forms of annotation.

You should *not* use `` to underline text for presentation purposes, or to denote titles of books.

### [Other elements to consider using](#other_elements_to_consider_using)

In most cases, you should use an element other than ``, such as:

* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em) to denote stress emphasis
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/b) to draw attention to text
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark) to mark key words or phrases
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) to indicate that text has strong importance
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite) to mark the titles of books or other publications
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i) to denote technical terms, transliterations, thoughts, or names of vessels in Western texts

To provide textual annotations (as opposed to the non\-textual annotations created with ``), use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ruby) element.

To apply an underlined appearance without any semantic meaning, use the [`text-decoration`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration) property's value `underline`.

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Indicating a spelling error](#indicating_a_spelling_error)

This example uses the `` element and some CSS to display a paragraph which includes a misspelled error, with the error indicated in the red wavy underline style which is fairly commonly used for this purpose.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\This paragraph includes a \wrnogly\ spelled word.\

\`\`\`
In the HTML, we see the use of `` with a class, `spelling`, which is used to indicate the misspelling of the word "wrongly".

#### CSS

css\`\`\`
u.spelling {
 text\-decoration: red wavy underline;
}

\`\`\`
This CSS indicates that when the `` element is styled with the class `spelling`, it should have a red wavy underline underneath its text. This is a common styling for spelling errors. Another common style can be presented using `red dashed underline`.

#### Result

The result should be familiar to anyone who has used any of the more popular word processors available today.

### [Avoiding \](#avoiding_u)

Most of the time, you actually don't want to use ``. Here are some examples that show what you should do instead in several cases.

#### Non\-semantic underlines

To underline text without implying any semantic meaning, use a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element with the [`text-decoration`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration) property set to `"underline"`, as shown below.

##### HTML

html\`\`\`
\Today's Special\
\
Chicken Noodle Soup With Carrots

\`\`\`
##### CSS

css\`\`\`
.underline {
 text\-decoration: underline;
}

\`\`\`
##### Result

#### Presenting a book title

Book titles should be presented using the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite) element instead of `` or even ``.

##### Using the cite element

html\`\`\`
\The class read \Moby\-Dick\ in the first term.\

\`\`\`

##### Styling the cite element

The default styling for the `` element renders the text in italics. You can override that using CSS:

html\`\`\`
\The class read \Moby\-Dick\ in the first term.\

\`\`\`
css\`\`\`
cite {
 font\-style: normal;
 text\-decoration: underline;
}

## <ul>: The Unordered List element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`compact` 
Deprecated](#compact)

This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent), and it doesn't work in all browsers.

**Warning:**
Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: use [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) instead. To give a similar effect as the `compact` attribute, the CSS property [`line-height`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height) can be used with a value of `80%`.

[`type` 
Deprecated](#type)

This attribute sets the bullet style for the list. The values defined under HTML3\.2 and the transitional version of HTML 4\.0/4\.01 are:

* `circle`
* `disc`
* `square`

A fourth bullet type has been defined in the WebTV interface, but not all browsers support it: `triangle`.

If not present and if no [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [`list-style-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) property applies to the element, the user agent selects a bullet type depending on the nesting level of the list.

**Warning:**
Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated; use the [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [`list-style-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) property instead.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

* The `` element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered\-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the [`list-style-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) property.
* The `` and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) elements may be nested as deeply as desired. Moreover, the nested lists may alternate between `` and `` without restriction.
* The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and `` elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) element, the order is meaningful. To determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) element should be used, otherwise you can use ``.

## <var>: The Variable element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/var)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser\-dependent.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

### [Related elements](#related_elements)

Other elements that are used in contexts in which `` is commonly used include:

* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code): The HTML Code element
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd): The HTML Keyboard input element
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/samp): The HTML Sample Output element

If you encounter code that is mistakenly using `` for style purposes rather than semantic purposes, you should either use a [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) with appropriate CSS or, an appropriate semantic element among the following:

* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i)
* [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q)
### [Default style](#default_style)

Most browsers apply [`font-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style) to `"italic"` when rendering ``. This can be overridden in CSS, like this:

css\`\`\`
var {
 font\-style: normal;
}

\`\`\`## [Examples](#examples)

### [Overriding the default style](#overriding_the_default_style)

Using CSS, you can override the default style for the `` element. In this example, variable names are rendered in bold, using Courier if it's available, otherwise it falls back to the default monospace font.

#### CSS

css\`\`\`
var {
 font:
 bold 15px "Courier",
 "Courier New",
 monospace;

## <video>: The Video Embed element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use `` for audio content as well, but the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

## [Try it](#try_it)

The above example shows simple usage of the `` element. Similarly to the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element, we include a path to the media we want to display inside the `src` attribute; we can include other attributes to specify information such as video width and height, whether we want it to autoplay and loop, or to show the browser's default video controls, etc.

The content inside the opening and closing `` tags is shown as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.

## [Attributes](#attributes)

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

[`autoplay`](#autoplay)

A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can without stopping to finish loading the data.

**Note:**
Modern browsers block audio (or videos with an unmuted audio track) from autoplaying, as sites that automatically play audio can be an unpleasant experience for users. See our [autoplay guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide) for additional information about how to properly use autoplay.

To disable video autoplay, `autoplay="false"` will not work; the video will autoplay if the attribute is there in the `` tag at all. To remove autoplay, the attribute needs to be removed altogether.

[`controls`](#controls)

If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control video playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.

[`controlslist`](#controlslist)

The [`controlslist`](https://wicg.github.io/controls-list/explainer.html) attribute, when specified, helps the browser select what controls to show for the `video` element whenever the browser shows its own set of controls (that is, when the `controls` attribute is specified).

The allowed values are `nodownload`, `nofullscreen` and `noremoteplayback`.

Use the [`disablepictureinpicture`](#disablepictureinpicture) attribute if you want to disable the Picture\-In\-Picture mode (and the control).

[`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin)

This [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related video. [CORS\-enabled resources](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image) can be reused in the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element without being *tainted*. The allowed values are:

[`anonymous`](#anonymous)

Sends a cross\-origin request without a credential. In other words, it sends the `Origin:` HTTP header without a cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:` HTTP header), the resource will be *tainted*, and its usage restricted.

[`use-credentials`](#use-credentials)

Sends a cross\-origin request with a credential. In other words, it sends the `Origin:` HTTP header with a cookie, a certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:` HTTP header), the resource will be *tainted* and its usage restricted.

When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the `Origin:` HTTP header), preventing its non\-tainted use in [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword `anonymous` was used. See [CORS settings attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) for additional information.

[`disablepictureinpicture`](#disablepictureinpicture)

Prevents the browser from suggesting a Picture\-in\-Picture context menu or to request Picture\-in\-Picture automatically in some cases.

[`disableremoteplayback`](#disableremoteplayback)

A Boolean attribute used to disable the capability of remote playback in devices that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI, etc.) and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay, etc.).

In Safari, you can use [`x-webkit-airplay="deny"`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AirPlayGuide/OptingInorOutofAirPlay/OptingInorOutofAirPlay.html) as a fallback.

[`height`](#height)

The height of the video's display area, in [CSS pixels](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#px) (absolute values only; [no percentages](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#dimension-attributes)).

[`loop`](#loop)

A Boolean attribute; if specified, the browser will automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video.

[`muted`](#muted)

A Boolean attribute that indicates the default audio mute setting contained in the video. If set, the audio will be initially silenced. Its default value is `false`, meaning the audio will be played when the video is played.

[`playsinline`](#playsinline)

A Boolean attribute indicating that the video is to be played "inline", that is, within the element's playback area. Note that the absence of this attribute *does not* imply that the video will always be played in fullscreen.

[`poster`](#poster)

A URL for an image to be shown while the video is downloading. If this attribute isn't specified, nothing is displayed until the first frame is available, then the first frame is shown as the poster frame.

[`preload`](#preload)

This [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience regarding what content is loaded before the video is played. It may have one of the following values:

* `none`: Indicates that the video should not be preloaded.
* `metadata`: Indicates that only video metadata (e.g. length) is fetched.
* `auto`: Indicates that the whole video file can be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it.
* *empty string*: A synonym of the `auto` value.

The default value is different for each browser. The spec advises it to be set to `metadata`.

**Note:**

* The `autoplay` attribute has precedence over `preload`. If `autoplay` is specified, the browser would obviously need to start downloading the video for playback.
* The specification does not force the browser to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.

[`src`](#src)

The URL of the video to embed. This is optional; you may instead use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) element within the video block to specify the video to embed.

[`width`](#width)

The width of the video's display area, in [CSS pixels](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#px) (absolute values only; [no percentages](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#dimension-attributes)).

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

Browsers don't all support the same video formats; you can provide multiple sources inside nested [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) elements, and the browser will then use the first one it understands.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
 \
 \
 Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
 \link to the video\ instead.
 \
\

\`\`\`
We offer a substantive and thorough [guide to media file types](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats) and the [guide to the codecs supported for video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs). Also available is a guide to [audio codecs that can be used with them](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs).

Other usage notes:

* If you don't specify the `controls` attribute, the video won't include the browser's default controls; you can create your own custom controls using JavaScript and the [`HTMLMediaElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) API. See [Creating a cross\-browser video player](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery/cross_browser_video_player) for more details.
* To allow precise control over your video (and audio) content, `HTMLMediaElement`s fire many different [events](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement#events). In addition to providing controllability, these events let you monitor the progress of both download and playback of the media, as well as the playback state and position.
* You can use the [`object-position`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) property to adjust the positioning of the video within the element's frame, and the [`object-fit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property to control how the video's size is adjusted to fit within the frame.
* To show subtitles/captions along with your video, you can use some JavaScript along with the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) element and the [WebVTT](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) format. See [Adding captions and subtitles to HTML video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video) for more information.
* You can play audio files using a `` element. This can be useful if, for example, you need to perform audio with a [WebVTT](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) transcript, since the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) element doesn't allow captions using WebVTT.
* To test the fallback content on browsers that support the element, you can replace `` with a non\-existing element like ``.

A good general source of information on using HTML `` is the [HTML video and audio](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_video_and_audio) beginner's tutorial.

### [Styling with CSS](#styling_with_css)

The `` element is a replaced element — its [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) value is `inline` by default — but its default width and height in the viewport is defined by the video being embedded.

There are no special considerations for styling ``; a common strategy is to give it a `display` value of `block` to make it easier to position, size, etc., and then provide styling and layout information as required. [Video player styling basics](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery/Video_player_styling_basics) provides some useful styling techniques.

### [Adding subtitles and other timed text tracks](#adding_subtitles_and_other_timed_text_tracks)

Timed text tracks for subtitles, closed captions, chapter headings, and so on, can be added declaratively by nesting the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) element.
The tracks are specified in [Web Video Text Tracks File Format (WebVTT)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API/Web_Video_Text_Tracks_Format) (`.vtt` files).

For example, the HTML below includes the file "captions.vtt", which will be used to overlay closed captions on the video if captions are enabled by the user.

html\`\`\`
\
 \
\

\`\`\`
Timed text tracks can also be added programmatically using the [WebVTT API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API).

### [Detecting track addition and removal](#detecting_track_addition_and_removal)

You can detect when tracks are added to and removed from a `` element using the [`addtrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoTrackList/addtrack_event "addtrack") and [`removetrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoTrackList/removetrack_event "removetrack") events. However, these events aren't sent directly to the `` element itself.
Instead, they're sent to the track list object within the `` element's [`HTMLMediaElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) that corresponds to the type of track that was added to the element:

[`HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/audioTracks)

An [`AudioTrackList`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioTrackList) containing all of the media element's audio tracks.
Add a listener for `addtrack` to this object to be notified when new audio tracks are added to the element.

[`HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/videoTracks)

A [`VideoTrackList`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoTrackList) containing all of the media element's video tracks.
Add an `addtrack` listener to this object to be notified when video tracks are added to the element.

[`HTMLMediaElement.textTracks`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/textTracks)

A [`TextTrackList`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextTrackList) containing all of the media element's text tracks (which are used for subtitles, closed captions, and so on).
Add an `addtrack` listener to this object to be notified when text tracks are added to the element.

For example, to detect when audio tracks are added to or removed from a `` element, you can use code like this:

js\`\`\`
const elem = document.querySelector("video");

elem.audioTracks.onaddtrack = (event) =\> {
 trackEditor.addTrack(event.track);
};

elem.audioTracks.onremovetrack = (event) =\> {
 trackEditor.removeTrack(event.track);
};

\`\`\`
This code watches for audio tracks to be added to and removed from the element, and calls a hypothetical function on a track editor to register and remove the track from the editor's list of available tracks.

You can also use [`addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener "addEventListener()") to listen for the [`addtrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoTrackList/addtrack_event "addtrack") and [`removetrack`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoTrackList/removetrack_event "removetrack") events.

### [Server support for video](#server_support_for_video)

If the MIME type for the video is not set correctly on the server, the video may not show or show a gray box containing an X (if JavaScript is enabled).

If you use Apache Web Server to serve WebM videos, you can fix this problem by adding the video file type extensions to the `video/webm` MIME type (the most common WebM file extension is `.webm`). To do this, edit the `mime.types` file in `/etc/apache` or use the `AddType` configuration directive in `httpd.conf`:

\`\`\`
AddType video/webm .webm

\`\`\`
Your web host may provide an easy interface to MIME type configuration changes for new technologies until a global update naturally occurs.

## [Accessibility](#accessibility)

Videos should provide both captions and transcripts that accurately describe their content (see [Adding captions and subtitles to HTML video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video) for more information on how to implement these). Captions allow people who are experiencing hearing loss to understand a video's audio content as the video is being played, while transcripts allow people who need additional time to be able to review audio content at a pace and format that is comfortable for them.

It's worth noting that while you can caption audio\-only media, you can only do so when playing audio in a `` element since the video region of the element is used to present the captions. This is one of the special scenarios in which it's useful to play audio in a video element.

If automatic captioning services are used, it is important to review the generated content to ensure it accurately represents the source video.

In addition to spoken dialog, subtitles and transcripts should also identify music and sound effects that communicate important information. This includes emotion and tone:

\`\`\`
14
00:03:14 \-\-\> 00:03:18
\[Dramatic rock music]

15
00:03:19 \-\-\> 00:03:21
\[whispering] What's that off in the distance?

16
00:03:22 \-\-\> 00:03:24
It's… it's a…

16 00:03:25 \-\-\> 00:03:32
\[Loud thumping]
\[Dishes clattering]

\`\`\`
Captions should not obstruct the main subject of the video. They can be positioned using [the `align` VTT cue setting](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API/Web_Video_Text_Tracks_Format#cue_settings).

* [Web Video Text Tracks Format (WebVTT)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API)
* [WebAIM: Captions, Transcripts, and Audio Descriptions](https://webaim.org/techniques/captions/)
* [MDN Understanding WCAG, Guideline 1\.2 explanations](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable#guideline_1.2_—_providing_text_alternatives_for_time-based_media)

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Single source](#single_source)

This example plays a video when activated, providing the user with the browser's default video controls to control playback.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
\
\
\
 Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can
 \download it\
 and watch it with your favorite video player!
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

Until the video starts playing, the image provided in the `poster` attribute is displayed in its place. If the browser doesn't support video playback, it displays the fallback text.

### [Multiple sources](#multiple_sources)

This example builds on the last one, offering three different sources for the media; this allows the video to be watched regardless of which video codecs are supported by the browser.

#### HTML

html\`\`\`
\
\
\
\
 \
 \

 Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can
 \
 download the MP4
 \
 and watch it with your favorite video player!
\

\`\`\`
#### Result

First AVI is tried. If that can't be played, [MP4](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers#mpeg-4_mp4) is tried. A fallback message is displayed if the video element isn't supported, but not if all sources fail.

Some media file types let you provide more specific information using the [`codecs`](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/codecs_parameter) parameter as part of the file's type string. A relatively simple example is `video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"`, which says that the file is a [WebM](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers#webm) video using [VP8](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs#vp8) for its video and [Vorbis](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs#vorbis) for audio.

## <wbr>: The Line Break Opportunity element - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/wbr)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line\-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.

## [Try it](#try_it)

## [Attributes](#attributes)

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## [Notes](#notes)

On UTF\-8 encoded pages, `` behaves like the `U+200B ZERO-WIDTH SPACE` code point. In particular, it behaves like a Unicode bidi BN code point, meaning it has no effect on [bidi](/en-US/docs/Glossary/BiDi)\-ordering: `123,456` displays, when not broken on two lines, `123,456` and not `456,123`.

For the same reason, the `` element does not introduce a hyphen at the line break point. To make a hyphen appear only at the end of a line, use the soft hyphen character entity (`&shy;`) instead.

## [Examples](#examples)

*[The Yahoo Style Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20121014054923/http://styleguide.yahoo.com/)* recommends [breaking a URL *before* punctuation](https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171040/http://styleguide.yahoo.com/editing/treat-abbreviations-capitalization-and-titles-consistently/website-names-and-addresses), to avoid leaving a punctuation mark at the end of the line, which the reader might mistake for the end of the URL.

## <xmp> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN

[Read the full article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/xmp)

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

## [Summary](#summary)

The **``** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.

**Note:**
Do not use this element.

* It has been deprecated since HTML3\.2 and was not implemented in a consistent way. It was completely removed from current HTML.
* Use the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre) element or, if semantically adequate, the [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code) element instead. Note that you will need to escape the ``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre) and [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code) elements to be used instead.
* The [``](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/plaintext) element, similar to `` but also obsolete.
